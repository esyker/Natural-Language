Monica	There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Monica	Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Monica	And they weren't looking at you before?!
Monica	Are you okay, sweetie?
Monica	(explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.
Monica	(to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
Monica	No you don't.
Monica	Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Monica	Rachel?!
Rachel	Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Monica	(pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Monica	So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Rachel	Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Monica	Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Rachel	Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]
Monica	Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Rachel	Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Monica	Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Monica	Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Phoebe	(sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
Monica	Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Monica	Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Monica	Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
Monica	Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Monica	Yes!
Monica	Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Monica	(to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
Monica	(horrified) Really?
Monica	Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
Monica	Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
Monica	Change! Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.
Monica	(yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Monica	-leg?
Monica	You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Monica	That's right.Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]
Chandler	Stay out of my freezer!Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]
Monica	What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Monica	Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Monica	Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Paul	Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually.
Monica	(spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Monica	I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Monica	Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Monica	(pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Monica	(entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Paul	(entering from Monica's room) Morning.
Monica	Stop!
Monica	We'll talk later.
Monica	Shut up, and put my table back.
Monica	Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Monica	Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Monica	So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Monica	I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Monica	Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Monica	Big time!
Monica	I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Monica	What for?
Frannie	Hey, Monica!
Monica	Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Monica	How do you do that?
Monica	You know Paul?
Monica	You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Monica	Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Monica	I hate men! I hate men!
Monica	Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Monica	I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Monica	How'd you pay for them?
Monica	And who pays for that?
Monica	C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Monica	All right, you ready?
Monica	You can, I know you can!
Monica	Rachel! That was a library card!
Monica	Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Monica	Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?
Monica	You be okay?
Rachel	Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?
Monica	That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Ross	You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Monica	See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Ross	I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)
Monica	What? I-I said you had a-
Monica	(to Phoebe) Would you stop?
Monica	I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Monica	What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Monica	Absolutely.
Monica	(taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?
Monica	Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Chandler	Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.
Phoebe	She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!
Monica	Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Phoebe	Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Monica	That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Monica	What?
Monica	Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!
Monica	You didn't.
Monica	I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)
Chandler	Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
Monica	(puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.
Monica	Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Monica	W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Monica	What does she mean by 'involved'?
Monica	Curry.
Monica	I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Monica	No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Mrs. Geller	Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)
Monica	Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Monica	I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Monica	What's that supposed to mean?
Monica	No it's not.
Monica	(trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Mrs. Geller	(To Monica) And you knew about this?!
Monica	Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.
Monica	Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Ross	(walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?
Monica	(welling up) Mm-hmm.
Monica	No.
Monica	Am not!
Monica	(pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!
Monica	Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Monica	Uh, Ross.
Monica	No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Monica	What did they do to you?
Monica	We're with you. We got it.
Monica	(puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?
Monica	Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Monica	'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Monica	Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
Monica	No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Monica	Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Monica	Nope. Schhorry.
Monica	I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Monica	I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Monica	Do you all promise?
Monica	(shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Monica	Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?
Monica	(to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Monica	Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Monica	(to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
Monica	C'mon!
Monica	Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Monica	Really!
Monica	Hi.. how was the game?
Monica	Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Monica	Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Monica	..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Monica	Oh, why is it unfair?
Chandler	So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Monica	Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Monica	Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Monica	Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Paula	Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
Monica	I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Monica	No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Monica	(entering) Hey. Where's Joey?
Monica	Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)
Joey	(dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going on?
Monica	Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Monica	(turns off the TV) Okay..
Monica	Please, guys, we have to talk.
Monica	Alright, we have to talk.
Monica	Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Monica	No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Monica	Look, I- I could go on pretending-
Monica	-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Monica	I'm sorry..
Monica	I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Monica	Are you guys gonna be okay?
Monica	(dubious) I understand.
Monica	I'm, I'm really sorry.
Monica	Relieved?
Monica	(entering) Hi.
Monica	Oh, y'know..
Monica	He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look)
Monica	Alright. Phoebe?
Monica	Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Monica	..Excuse me?
Monica	How does she do that?
Monica	Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Monica	What's going on with you?
Monica	Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Monica	Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Monica	Wow, you worked in a mine?
Monica	Yeah, yeah.
Monica	(to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Phoebe	(to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They scream.)
Monica	Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the contents of the blender into some glasses.)
Monica	Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Monica	We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
Monica	Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Monica	(on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Monica	That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Monica	(pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Monica	You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Rachel	Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
Monica	Ah, the other Jack.
Monica	So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Rachel	Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Monica	...Pheebs?
Monica	No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (There's a knock on the door.)
Monica	Phoebe?
Monica	Do you have a plan?
Monica	(leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Monica	Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Monica	Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Monica	(staggered) Oh God.
Monica	Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window.)
Monica	I see pizza!
Monica	White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Monica	Please tell me it's his mother.
Monica	Oh, no...
Monica	Light still out?
Monica	Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Monica and Phoebe	Shut up!
Monica	I think he's shy.
Monica	Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Monica	Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Monica	Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Monica	What?! You slept with Jason?
Monica	Oh, that's nice!
Monica	Excuse me?!
Monica	Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Rachel	I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica and Rachel start to squabble)
Monica	Where?
Monica	Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Ross	(Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Monica	Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
Monica	Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Monica	Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Monica	Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Monica	Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Monica	Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Rachel	Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Joey	You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Joey	Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Monica	Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Monica	(looking out window) Oh, god help us.
Monica	Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Monica	What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Ross	(on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Monica	Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Monica	Which?
Monica	You've never met Bob, have you?
Monica	Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Monica	...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Monica	(to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up?
Monica	How, how did that happen?
Monica	What?
Bob	Monica, Monica is great.
Monica	I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Monica	It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
Monica	Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Monica	Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Monica	Oh my god.
Monica	Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Monica	Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Monica	Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Monica	Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Monica	(hits him lightly) Oh!
Monica	(leaving) I'm outta here.
Monica	Really?
Monica	I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Monica	Hi.
Monica	We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Monica	(notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.
Monica	Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Monica	Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Monica	You could do that!
Phoebe	(reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Monica	Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Monica	Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Monica	What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Monica	Good for you, Joey.
Monica	We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Monica	...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Monica	How-how did that happen?
Monica	Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Monica	You guys, I am not that bad!
Phoebe	Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Monica	That is so unfair!
Monica	Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Monica	Why not?
Monica	I could do that.
Monica	Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Monica	STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Ross	Monica? You're Mom.
Monica	Well, what's the part?
Monica	(trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
Monica	Alright, alright, alright...
Monica	For what?
Monica	Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Monica	He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Monica	I warned you...
Chandler	Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Monica	Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Chandler	No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)
Monica	Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Monica	Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Monica	Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Monica	I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Monica	(determined) Uh-huh!
Monica	Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her room.)
Monica	(hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)
Monica	Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Monica	(into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs up)
Phoebe	Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. (to Monica) What's my number?
Monica	Hello?
Monica	(to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
Monica	What?
Monica	I have no idea what you just said.
Monica	OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Monica	Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Monica	You did not go!
Monica	Outside.
Monica	Why not?
Monica	And that would be?
Monica	Joey, what's going on?
Monica	About what?
Monica	Oh my God! I love him!
Monica	My surprise party!
Monica	Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Monica	No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Phoebe	Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks like I was second to last.
Monica, Joey, and Phoebe	(singing) I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Monica	(to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Rachel	(entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Monica	(smitten) Hi!
Monica	Hi!
Monica	Hi!
Rachel	(to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
Monica	If you want, I'll do it.
Joey	Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Monica	I did.
Monica	Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Monica	Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Rachel	Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.
Monica	Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
Monica	How-how are you, Mom?
Monica	What?
Monica	Nothing.
Monica	She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Monica	Oh God!
Monica	The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Monica	I know.
Monica	G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)
Monica	Ross!
Monica	We checked. A lot.
Monica	Dad!
Monica	You what?
Monica	Define fun.
Monica	...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Monica	That's probably what they'll say.
Monica	Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Monica	Are these the shoes?
Monica	It was a really beautiful service.
Mrs. Geller	Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. (Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)
Monica	Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Ross	Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)
Mrs. Geller	(to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.
Monica	Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Monica	That sounds like Nana.
Monica	...I can imagine.
Monica	That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Monica	How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Monica	Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Monica	Huh.
Monica	Oh, I think so.
Mrs. Geller	(reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises) Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Monica	Thank you. They're yours.
Monica	Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Rachel	Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Monica	Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Joey	Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Monica	Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Monica	Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Monica	I am not wrong.
Monica	No, I just talked to them.
Monica	Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
Ross	(to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Monica	Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Monica	You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Monica	And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Monica	Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Monica	So you're free Thursday, then.
Monica	Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Monica	Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Monica	Rach, here's your mail.
Monica	(insistently) No, here's your mail.
Monica	(gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
Monica	We all chipped in.
Joey	(to Monica) We did?
Monica	(to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
Monica	(hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Monica	Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?
Monica	All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Joey	Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Monica	That's not a question.
Monica	All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Monica	Ah!
Monica	What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Monica	Why would we do that?
Monica	Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Monica	Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Monica	Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Monica	No I don't.
Monica	No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Monica	(panicked) The oven is on.
Monica	Well then get it, get it!
Monica	(angry) Joey!
Monica	Can you go any faster with that?
Monica	Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Monica	I swear you said you had the keys.
Monica	Why would I have the keys?
Monica	But I didn't.
Monica	Why?
Monica	Why?
Monica	Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Chandler	Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Monica	Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Monica	No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Monica	Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Monica	Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Monica	Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Monica	(holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Monica	Make a wish?
Monica	W-wait. What is that?
Monica	No, no, I don't.
Monica	Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Monica	Why don't you just get a roommate?
Monica	So, how'd it go?
Monica	So what are you gonna be?
Monica	I think it's romantic.
Monica	What?!
Monica	Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Monica	Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Monica	Do you always have to bring him here?
Monica	I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	What's the matter?
Monica	Vividly.
Monica	Hi.
Monica	That thing is not coming in here.
Monica	I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Monica	Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Monica	Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Rachel	No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?
Monica	Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Chandler	Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Monica	Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Monica	So I'm kissing everyone?
Monica	Why?
Monica	Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Monica	He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Monica and Phoebe	(in unison) Thanks.
Monica	We are not going to whistle.
Monica	No!
Monica	No!
Monica	(Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
Monica	Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Monica	Phoebe, what are you doing?
Monica	I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Monica	Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Monica	I wish all guys could be like him.
Monica	He doesn't have anyone.
Monica	Last night.
Monica	Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
Monica	Nah... not-not special enough.
Monica	Waaay too special.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	(Entering) What are you guys doing here?
Monica	...What did I ask?
Monica	Hi.
Monica	What are you doing here?
Monica	I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Phoebe	No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Monica	How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	(Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Monica	(Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Monica	Hello.
Monica	No, you?
Monica	You just asked me.
Phoebe	Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look) 'Kay. (Sung:)
Monica	Oh! You're awake!
Monica	You look good!
Monica	Oh, sorry.
Monica	I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Monica	I got you the foot massager.
Monica	I read to you.
Phoebe	I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
Monica	Oh, my pleasure.
Monica	"See you around?"
Monica	Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Monica	This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Monica	What's a 'niffle'?
Monica	Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Phoebe	(softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)
Monica	Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Monica	So, did I hear Poconos?
Monica	Yeah, that's a big step.
Ross	Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Monica	And Monica knows...
Monica	Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Joey	So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest)
Monica	I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Monica	Phoebe, what's the matter?
Monica	Phoebe, what is it?
Monica	Well, what happened?
Monica	Are you sure?
Monica	Was it...?
Monica	Oh!
Monica	So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Monica	Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at Chandler) You suck!
Monica	We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game! Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)
Monica	Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
Monica	Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Monica	Oh, you're right.
Ross	(pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
Monica	Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Girls	Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)
Monica	Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Monica	Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Monica	You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.
Monica	So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Monica	Hey, how long are you in the city?
Monica	Hello?
Monica	C'mon up.
Monica	Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Monica	Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Monica	Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Monica	You're welcome.
Monica	Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
Monica	Hi...May I help you?
Monica	Okay...who are you?
Monica	Oh, c'mon in.
Monica	How's it going?
Monica	Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
Monica	So you talked to your dad, huh.
Monica	How's it going?
Joey	Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel)
Monica	Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Monica	Hello, Joey.
Monica	You can not do this.
Monica	Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Monica	But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Monica	Which one was Pete Carney?
Monica	Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Monica	I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Monica	There's more beer, right?
Monica	Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Monica	Burning's good.
Monica	Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Monica	Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Janice	Hi, Monica.
Monica	Rach, come see who's out here!
Monica	I'll be right back.
Monica	Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to Chandler) He just happened to call.
Monica	All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Monica	Can we just start throwing things in?
Monica	Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Monica	No.
Monica	Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Monica	You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
Monica	They're nice guys.
Rachel	And a nice hot cider for Monica. (Hands it to her.)
Monica	Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?
Monica	Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Monica	Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Monica	(taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.
Phoebe	Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Phoebe	(to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!
Monica	Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Monica	(excited) Oh my God!
Phoebe	OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!
Monica	Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Monica	So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Monica	So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Rachel	(pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?
Monica	I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Phoebe	Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. (sits down)
Monica	(to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse.
Monica	Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Monica	Yeah, well, is that better?
Joey	I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Monica	(brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Monica	It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Monica	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)
Monica	Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Monica	Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Monica	But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Monica	(shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)
Monica	Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Monica	Ten dollars an hour.
Monica	Twelve dollars an hour.
Monica	You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour.
Rachel	Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Monica	Hi Steve!
Steve	Hello, Monica. (to Rachel) Hello, greeter girl.
Monica	(to Steve) This is Rachel.
Phoebe	(overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop) of, OK, smells.
Monica	Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Monica	Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... (Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he finishes)... ginger.
Monica	I'm so glad you liked them!
Monica	Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Monica	(joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Monica	You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Monica	No, we don't. (reaches for box)
Monica	Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Monica	Give them to me.
Monica	No, give me the...
Monica	(furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
Monica	What?
Monica	Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Monica	I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.

Monica	Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
Monica	Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
Monica	Really?
Monica	Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her friend and kisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Monica	(No longer touched) you don't have insurance?
Monica	I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Monica	Well there's not much we can do.
Monica	Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
Monica	(Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her voice anyway) That's insurance fraud.
Monica	(Jumping up to make Rachel sit down) Okay, okay. I hate this.
Monica	(to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tiny laugh) these forms (tiny laugh).
Monica	(Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) I put mine.
Monica	(Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am that stupid (tiny laugh).
Dr. Mitchell	Okay, errrr, Monica?
Monica	Yes? (jumping as Rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is.
Rachel (as Monica)	Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Monica (as Rachel)	Hi.
Monica (as Rachel)	Thank you.
Rachel (as Monica)	Right.
Monica	Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Monica	I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Rachel	What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Monica	Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Monica	Oh...
Monica	Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Monica	Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Monica	Hi, come on in.
Monica	Hi, Geoffrey.
Dr. Rosen	So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Monica	It's uh...
Monica (as Rachel)	..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Rachel (as Monica)	You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... (They don't know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room) STAT!
Monica	It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Rachel	Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Monica	A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Monica	I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Monica	Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
Monica	What?
Monica	What!?
Monica	(getting angry) What!!?
Rachel	(as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Monica	(as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Monica	(as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?
Dr. Rosen	So, Monica, what do you do?
Rachel	(as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Rachel	(as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Monica	(as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Rachel	(as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Monica	(as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.
Rachel	(as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Monica	(as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both do that!
Dr. Mitchell	(on the phone) Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... (handing it to Monica) ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Monica	(as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Monica	(as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Rachel	(on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing "You are...") ...dead!
Monica	Ross, he's got the remote again.
Rachel and Monica	Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Monica	I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Monica	(taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank you. (Hangs up)
Monica	We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Monica	Thank you.
Monica	Yes.
Monica	Hi.
Rachel	(as Monica) Hi, remember us?
Monica	(as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause um...
Monica	(as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)
Rachel	(as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Rachel	(as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Monica	What's goin' on?
Rachel and Monica	Oh, thank you.
Monica	Michael.
Monica	(as Rachel) Monica.
Rachel	(as Monica) Oh.
Monica	(as Rachel) Hi.
Rachel	(as Monica) Hi.
Monica	Oh, look, he's waking up!
Monica	A quin pidio el pollo General Tso? (Who ordered General Sal's chicken?)
Monica	Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. (Look, Ross, Marcel's got the remote.)
Monica	Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
Monica	Hey, guys.
Rachel	Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? (to Monica, quietly): Did you bring the mail?
Monica	Lots of responses.
Rachel	(to Monica): Really? (out loud): Sure, we have scones left! (to Monica): OK, read them to me.
Monica	(reading): OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. (crumpes up letter)
Monica	Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Monica	I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Monica	So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Monica	Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Joey	Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)
Monica	Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Monica	(throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Monica	Hell no, we'll pay!
Phoebe	OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Monica	And you know what? We want a rematch.
Monica	Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Monica	What?
Phoebe	Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Monica	Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Monica	That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Monica	You're kidding! Where? Where?
Monica	Oh, Rachel!
Monica	Well, what's the job?
Monica	OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!
Monica	I don't think so.
Monica	What?
Monica	Really?
Monica	Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Monica	OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Monica	Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Ross	So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Monica	You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Monica	OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Monica	Excuse me, where are you going?
Monica	Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Monica	Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)
Monica	Me too.
Rachel	I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Phoebe	Monica, in or out?
Monica	(slams down cards) I hate this game!
Monica	Sorry, Rach.
Monica	Alright, check.
Rachel	See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Monica	Rachel, there's nothing in it.
Monica	OK, here you go. Good luck.
Rachel	(to Monica): Thank you. (to Ross): I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
Monica	(pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Monica	That, you get? That, you get?
Monica	Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Monica	Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Monica	What is it?
Monica	Barry who you almost...?
Monica	And Mindy, your maid of...?
Monica	(Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
Monica	Hi.
Monica	Wonderful!
Monica	There was nudity!
Monica and Phoebe	Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Monica	Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Ross	'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
Rachel	Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the open door)
Rachel	I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Monica	Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Monica	Which ones?
Monica	He- he pooped in my shoe.
Monica	Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Monica	Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Monica	Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Monica	Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Monica	No!
Monica	A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Monica	Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Monica	Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Monica	Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Rachel	Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Monica	The Luisa from home room!
Monica	No, none at all.
Monica	Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Monica	Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Monica	Marcel?
Monica	Whaaat!
Monica	What is it?
Monica	Look, Phoebe!
Monica	What're you gonna do?
Monica	Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?
Monica	Oh gosh.
Monica	This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Monica	That's because I'm in front of them.
Monica	Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Monica	Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Monica	(looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Monica	So have you called her yet?
Monica	I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Monica	Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Monica	How'd it go?
Monica	Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Monica	Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Monica	That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Monica	(looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Monica	Great, now he's waving back.
Monica	What kinda stuff?
Monica	Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Monica	Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Monica	(wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Monica	Uh huh.
Monica	You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Monica	Brrrrrrr!
Monica	Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Monica	Why don't you just take it with you?
Monica	Why don't you just call her?
Monica	Do you?
Chandler	No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Monica	Don't you have to pee?
Monica	Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just pointing out the irony.
Joey	(to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Monica	So she's a woman! So what?
Monica	Joey!!
Joey	(on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Monica	The green dress? Really?
Monica	(waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
Monica	You okay?
Monica	Really?
Monica	Aww... (They hug)
Monica	Yeah, there you go!
Monica	I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Rachel	Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
Monica	I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Monica	That's me.
Monica	Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Rachel	Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Monica	This woman's living my life.
Monica	She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Monica	Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Rachel	Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Monica	Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Monica	Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Monica	This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Monica	Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Monica	(Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap class.
Monica	This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Rachel	Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
Phoebe	This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
Monica	What d'you think?
Monica	Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Monica	Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Monica	Okay, I'm not getting this!
Monica	Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Monica	Great. It's gym class all over again.
Monica	Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Woman	Hi. I'm Monica.
Monica	Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Woman	(Fake Monica) Monana?
Monica	Yeah. It's Dutch.
Fake Monica	You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)
Monica	Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Monica	Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Fake Monica	Monana was very brave.
Monica	It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Fake Monica	So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Monica	...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Fake Monica	Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Monica	'Scuse me?
Fake Monica	There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Monica	Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Fake Monica	Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Monica	What?
Fake Monica	Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Monica	Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Fake Monica	I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Monica	Uh-huh.
Fake Monica	I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Monica	Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Monica	Yo- hooo!
Monica	Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Monica	Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Rachel	Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Rachel	Monica? Monica!
Monica	Water rules!
Monica	Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Rachel	Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Monica	No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Monica	Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Monica	They've arrested Monica.
Monica	Hi.
Fake Monica	Hey.
Monica	How are you?
Fake Monica	I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Monica	Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Fake Monica	That I was not expecting.
Monica	I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Fake Monica	Oh. Thanks.
Monica	No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Fake Monica	Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Monica	I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Fake Monica	Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica	Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Fake Monica	There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Monica	Not necessarily...
Fake Monica	Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Monica	Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Fake Monica	Really? Then why are you like that?
Monica	In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
Monica	Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
Monica	Tell him.
Monica	Just...please tell him.
Monica	Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Chandler	Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)
Monica	Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Monica	All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)
Monica	Thank you.
Monica	He's... our age.
Monica	Okay, he's a senior in college.
Monica	No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Monica	Oh, I can't pass for 22?
Monica	I am 26.
Monica	Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?
Monica	What?
Monica	I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Did not.
Monica	How was that possible?
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Unless...
Monica	Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
Monica	Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Monica	Ethan?
Monica	Are you a virgin?
Monica	Really?
Monica	You keep saying that.
Monica	Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Monica	No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Monica	Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Monica	But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Monica	You're not a senior?
Monica	Ok...ay.
Monica	What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Monica	Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Monica	Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Monica	Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)
Monica	Really?
Monica	Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Monica	What?
Monica	Oh.
Monica	No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Monica	Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Monica	Aren't you gonna...
Monica	That was gonna be my opener.
Rachel	(understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Young Ethan	All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
Monica	It was.
Monica	Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Monica	This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Young Ethan	No, don't say it. (closes Monica's mouth with his hand)
Monica	...love you.
Ross	Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
Ross	Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Monica	I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Monica	I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Monica	Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Monica	What's with the guitar?
Monica	I want a baby.
Monica	Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Monica	No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Monica	Oh yeah? When?
Monica	Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica	Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica	What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Monica	Well?
Monica	Did you go home and change?
Monica	No, I haven't seen him.
Monica	Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance? (Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Monica	I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Monica	Hi.
Monica	Can we come in?
Monica	Ross, can I?
Monica	(getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Monica	He is so amazing.
Monica	Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Monica	Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Monica	OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Phoebe	We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... (hands meat to Monica)
Monica and Phoebe	Ewww!
Monica	Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Monica	Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Monica	Man's got a point.
Monica	Joey... we always know what you mean.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	You're going to China?
Ross	Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to Monica)
Ross	(to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Monica	You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Monica	(gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Monica	Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Monica	So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Monica	Y'know, just be there for her.
Monica	Think about it.
Monica	I can't believe he did this.
Monica	I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Monica	No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Monica	From here to the airport?
Monica	Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Monica	Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Monica	Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Monica and Phoebe	Sure.
Monica	Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Monica	Another good point.
Monica	Why isn't it working out?
Monica	Is he not cute enough for you?
Monica	Does he not make enough money?
Monica	Is there? Is there someone else?
Monica	Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Monica	Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Monica	Oh, from who?
Monica	Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Rachel	Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Monica	Oh, why?
Monica	(gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Rachel	Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Monica	I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Monica	Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Monica	I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Monica	Guys, you got your hair cut.
Ross	That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
Monica	This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Monica	(to Julie) It's an expression.
Monica	Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
Monica	No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Monica	Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
Monica	Why not?
Monica	No you're not.
Rachel	(to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Monica	Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
Monica	(to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back.
Monica	Rachel, how did this happen?
Monica	Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Monica	My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake.
Monica	(to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Phoebe	All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Monica	I promise.
Phoebe	All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
Monica	What? I didn't say anything.
Phoebe	Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
Monica	I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Monica	How who wears it?
Monica	Demi Moore is not a he.
Monica	That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Monica	I know!
Monica	Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Monica	Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Chandler	Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Monica	(entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)
Monica	Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Joey	Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Monica	It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Monica	But I'm...
Phoebe	Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Ross	(to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Monica	Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
Ross	It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Monica	You're welcome.
Monica	Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
Monica	We were shopping, and we had lunch.
Monica	You had a salad.
Phoebe	I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Phoebe	Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs.
Phoebe	(Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Monica	Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju(Sees Rachel is watching)Hi, Jew! (Walks into the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)
Monica	Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Monica	Hey, where is everybody?
Monica	Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Monica	That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Rachel	Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Monica	Judy.
Monica	Julie.
Monica	Jody!
Monica	Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Monica	Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Monica	Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Monica	That is not true!
Monica	Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Rachel	Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? (Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now. (Exits.)
Monica	(on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve.
Monica	I don't know what else to say.
Monica	I feel terrible, I really do.
Monica	Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Monica	It's that terrible?
Rachel	Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually (starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you.
Monica	Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, (starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Monica	Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Monica	(crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)
Rachel	Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
RACHEL	Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
RACHEL	Monica, let it go.
RACHEL	Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
RACHEL	Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
PHOEBE	I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
RACHEL	[to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
RACHEL	Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
ROSS	Monica!
ROSS	Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
PHOEBE	I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
JOEY	'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
CHANDLER	Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
STEVE	Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
MONICA	(on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
ROSS	There we go. All better. (gives Ben back to Monica)
CHANDLER	Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica, Ben cries. When he moves Ben away, he stops crying.)
CHANDLER	Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
CHAN	OK, let's do it. [Monica looks at him funny] What?
RACH	Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
ROSS	Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
MICH	I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
MICH	Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
CHAN	No, no, no, no, no, no [opens door to Monica] No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
MNCA	No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo [Chandler walks out of the apartment, leaving Monica] Woo.
CHAN	Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
PHOE	Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
RACH	[to Monica] Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
CHANDLER	So whaddya got there Monica?
JOEY	Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
ROSS	Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
CHANDLER	Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug, Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]
JOEY	Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
FBOB	Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes. [kisses Monica]
JOEY	Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
MRS GREEN	Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
CHANDLER	Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
PHOEBE	Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
ROSS	Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. [Marcel doesn't react so Ross starts singing] In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. [no reaction from Marcel, Monica and Joey urge him on] In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. [Marcel looks over and everyone joins in] a-weema-way, a-weema-way..... [Marcel runs over and hops up on Ross's shoulder]
RACHEL	Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. [Monica starts making faces behind her back] She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
PHOEBE	Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
RACHEL	Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
RACHEL	OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
RACHEL	OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play. [She grabs a jar of tomato sauce and Monica's purse]
VAN DAMME	[to Rachel] I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, [to Monica] or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
MONICA	I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]
ROSS	Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
ROSS	C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
JOEY	[pulls out a VCR tape] Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
JOEY	Some girl ate Monica.
ROY	He'll be here OK, take a chill pill. [Chip pins Monica's corsage on, Monica then turns and whispers to Rachel]
RACHEL	God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
RACHEL	Monica.
RACHEL	Monica.
RACHEL	Monica.
ROSS	Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here.
ROSS	Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
FRIEND	Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city. [Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]
FRIEND	She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up. [Monica folds her arms over her breasts]
RACHEL	Oh really, OK. [shows Monica her tattoo]
ROSS	No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. [Monica comes out of her room] Oh, were you takin' a nap?
ROSS	Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
PHOEBE	Monica.
PHOEBE	Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
RACHEL	Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
RICHARD	Monica.
RACHEL and MONICA	One two three. [Rachel picks rock, Monica picks scissors]
PHOEBE	Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
RACHEL	Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
RICHARD	Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
PHOEBE	What, what's about to happen? [starts watching] I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END. [hear the gunshot from the TV]Scene:Monica and Rachel's apartment. Richard is on the balcony smoking and Monica is on the phone.]
JOEY	Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
CHANDLER	Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. [starts poking Monica in the shoulder] 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
CHANDLER	I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old [Monica gives him a glare] -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
JOEY	[Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
CHANDLER	No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
JOEY	Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
JOEY	Monica, relax, go get a beer.
RACHEL	Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
PHOEBE	Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone that's sitting by Monica]
JOEY	By someone besides Monica?
CHANDLER	Hi Monica.
CHANDLER	Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment] Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
CHANDLER	Ok, they're coming, shhh. [Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl to take to his apartment]
RACHEL	Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
CHANDLER	It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
MONICA	Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
RICHARD	Monica... [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
RACHEL	No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
RICHARD	Monica, wake up. Monica.
PHOEBE	Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.
JOEY	(entering) Man, I got this close to him (holds up his fingers) and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
RICHARD	Okay, last chance. (Monica throws the candy and hits some woman in the back of the head, Richard turns around and says) Again, I'm sorry.
RICHARD	Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
Phoebe	Hi Monica!
Janice	(entering and singing) Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. (laughs hysterically) Good morning Joey.
Monica	God, look what I found in the drain.
Monica	It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with this?
Monica	It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)
Monica	God, what is wrong with me.
Monica	I need to get some Richard.
Rachel	Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Monica	I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Monica	What are you the memory woman?
Ross	(entering with Monica in tow) Hey!
Monica	Hi.
Monica	Oh, they-they sent me home.
Monica	Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Monica	I know I do.
Monica	Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Monica	I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Monica	All right, I'll try not to.
Monica	Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Monica	I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Monica	Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Monica	(crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Phoebe	Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Monica	Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe leave)
Video	April Twelve, Eighteen hundred, Sixty-One (Monica lights Richard's cigar butt), 4:30 A.M. on Tuesday, the United States garrison at Fort Sumter was fired upon (knock on door) it is now under bombardment by....
Monica	Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Monica	I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Monica	What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Monica	Oh.
Monica	I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Monica	No, I really, really do.
Monica	Really!
Monica	You're not just saying that are you?
Monica	Was he crying?
Monica	Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
Monica	I think so.
Mr. Geller	Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turns around and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picks up the cigar, and starts watching the video)
Monica	(entering) Hi.
Monica	Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
Monica	(to Ross) Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Monica	Hang on a second I just got in.
Monica	Has somebody been drinking my fat? (Joey and Chandler look at each other)
Monica	Rach, did you check the machine?
Richard	(on machine) "Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
Monica	Is-is-is that message old or new? (yelling) Old or new?! Old or new?!
Monica	What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Monica	Huh?
Ross	I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. (Rachel starts to follow Monica into her room, but Ross stops her and sends her back to her room.) There we go, there we go.
Phoebe	Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
Monica	If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Monica	So, should I call him back?
The Guys	Noo! (Monica starts to go back into her room and stops) NO!
Rachel	Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Monica	I called him.
Monica	Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Monica	Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Joey	Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Monica	I know the code to his answering machine.
Monica	(on machine) "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Monica	He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Phoebe	Monica, you don't know that.
Monica	Well, who's voice was that?
Monica	Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Monica	It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Rachel	Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Monica	(entering from her room) Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Chandler	Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Monica	Okay. That was her right?
Monica	See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Phoebe	I'll get it, okay. (answers phone) Hi, Monica and Rachel's. (listens) Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. (to Monica) Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Monica	(on phone) Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. (listens) Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Monica	(on phone) Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! (Michelle hangs up) That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Monica	Okay, fine. (runs to her room)
Ross	(to Joey) How 'bout instead you, go get changed! (to Chandler) You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica! (Joey and Chandler start to leave, Joey is lunging as he is walking)
Chandler	Stop it. Stop it! (Monica runs into the living room, and starts dialing the phone)
Phoebe	Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Monica	Not any more!
Monica	Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Monica	Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
Monica	(on machine) "Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
Monica	I don't know!
Monica	Noooo!!!!
Monica	Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Monica	Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Monica	Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Rachel	Monica's making jam.
Monica	I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)
Rachel	(reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Monica	(entering) Hey guys.
Monica	Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.
Monica	Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Monica	I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Monica	I'm talking about me having a baby.
Monica	Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Monica	It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Monica	I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Monica	(entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Monica	You're gonna what?
Monica	What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Monica	Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Monica	Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Monica	Joey, this is you!
Monica	Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Monica	I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Phoebe	Thank you, Monica.
Monica	Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	To the bank.
Monica	Sperm.
Monica	Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Monica	'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Monica	What?
Monica	Really? Why?
Monica	Hoyt?
Monica	Really, is he a swimmer?
Monica	I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?
Monica	We do not have one of those signs.
Monica	Two girls and a boy?
Monica	And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Joey	Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Monica	Yeah.
Joey	Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for like a day. (hugs her again).
Janice	Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. (they start to kiss and lean back into Monica.)
Monica	Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Monica	See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Phoebe	(on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)
Monica	Oh, now you want a pad.
Monica	(entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Monica	There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
Monica	What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Monica	Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Chandler	Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we have any thoughts here?
Rachel and Monica	Uff.
Monica	That is never good.
Rachel and Monica	Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)
Monica	Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Monica	You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Monica	Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Rachel and Monica	Nooo!
Monica	She has to know that your not ready.
Monica	My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Monica	You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Chandler	(answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?
Monica	If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Monica	Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Monica	Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)
Monica	What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Monica	Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Monica	The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Monica	How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Monica	Wasn't there a little song?
Ross	There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!
Monica	(singing) 'I am Bea.'
Monica	'I drink tea.'
Monica	'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
Monica	A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the bathroom)
Young Monica	(entering the shot) Ross!!! (starts to wipe up the spill)
Monica	No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Monica	So, Chandler, whos on your list?
Joey	Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Monica	First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Phoebe	This is Monica.
Joey	Well, you shouldve told me that before, Im not a mind reader. Hey, were out of beer. Im going to Monicas.
Monica	Hey! Where ya headin in those pants? 1982?
Joey	Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Monica	Why, whats wrong with my bathroom floor?
Monica	I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)
Joey	Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.
Monica	I cant live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Monica	Thats a little more than I wanted to see.
Joey	(manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. Itd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)
Monica	I cant leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Monica	You know thats nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Monica	What kind of karate is that?
Monica	So hows it going with you guys?
Monica	Oh honey, were close now but you-you wouldnt believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe shakes her head like she doesnt understand) Thats where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Monica	Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Monica	Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Monica	I just asked you.
Monica	No, that is what the game is.
Monica	Whats the matter?
Monica	Hes retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)
Monica	Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Frank	Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
Monica	Its beautiful! Its like the first bathroom floor there ever was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Monica	And who laminated it?
Monica	Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.
Monica	Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it?
Monica	Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Joey	Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Monica and Rachel	What?!!
Monica	(entering from bedroom) Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
Monica	Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye. (leaves)
Monica	(entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the floor or come over no more!
Monica	What?
Monica	Hi.
Monica	Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Monica	Chris says theyre closing down the bar.
Monica	Yeah, apparently theyre turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Monica	Got me.
Monica	Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Monica	Is it the Italian guy?
Monica	Hes so cute.
Monica	Oh look, the pool tables free. Rack em up. Ill be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Chandler	(picks it up) And now Ive picked it up again. (walks over to Monica.)
Monica	Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!
Rachel	Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)
Monica	Oh my God, you cant even see where the Titanic hit it.
Monica	Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Monica	Aww, not right now.
Monica	I know.
Monica	So, Ill get-get back to my friend.
Monica	Oh, thatd be great.
Monica	Thanks.
Monica	Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
Phoebe	(to Monica, whos entering) Hey, youre early.
Monica	What are you doing with the lamp?
Monica	Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week.
Monica	Hi, again.
Monica	Thank you soo, much.
Monica	You want some help with that?
Monica	Whoa! Are you okay?
Monica	Its the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away) And-and the humidity.
Monica	Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Monica	Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Monica	This place is really my Grandmothers. (Joey starts to take off all of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Monica	(turning around) Okay, heres your penis!
Monica	Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Monica	So?!
Monica	Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Monica	I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Monica	Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Monica	Pheebs?
Monica	Wheres your bed?
Phoebe	Its not in the apartment? (Monica gives a Come on look) Oh no. I cant believe this is happening again.
Monica	What?
Monica	What are you talking about?
Monica	Everybody knows!
Phoebe	That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Monica	Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Monica	What?!?!
Monica	You can spill. In the sink.
Monica	I love you, too.
Monica	What? Im just said.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	(all depressed) Help yourself.
Monica	Phoebe moved out.
Monica	I dont understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I dont have a boyfriend?
Monica	Well, I think so.
Monica	I know, it is isnt it?
Monica	Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Monica	Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Monica	I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)
Monica	Hey, are you okay?
Monica	Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Monica	I was always Joanne.
Monica	I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And Im appalled for you by the way.
Monica	Whats the part?
Phoebe	Ugh! I dont know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler.
Monica	Not at these prices.
Monica	(lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Phoebe	Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend... (hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Phoebe	Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. Its that bedroom there. (points to Monicas room)
Joey	Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Phoebe	Im, Im freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have! All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Phoebe	I am soo dead. (goes to Monicas room)
Monica	(sees the bed) Whats this?
Monica	This is not the bed I ordered!
Monica	Phoebe!
Monica	Why is this car in my bedroom?
Monica	When did I sign for it?
Monica	Did you make brownies today?
Monica	(to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he wont notice the bed.
Phoebe	Its Monicas bed. What?
Chandler	Okay. (to Monica) Its a racecar.
Phoebe	So. This has always been Monicas bed, what youre just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Monica	Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.)
Monica	Joey, youre this guys teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Joey	Because, Monica, the guys so good, and I really, really want this part.
Monica	Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Jester	Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
Joey	(entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Monica	You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Monica	So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Ross	You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths Dont worry, Ill be here the whole time. to Ross.) Yes! Thatd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica sarcastically mouths Yeah! and holds up her thumb.)
Monica	Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. (takes Ben) Were gonna do something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in the air a little bit and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits Bens head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)
Monica	(to Ben) Whos so brave, youre so brave, yes you are, youre so brave.
Rachel	Okay. Okay honey, hes fine, hes fine, lets just put him down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See thats a good boy. (to Monica) How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Monica	Hes not gonna say anything, because were not gonna tell him.
Monica	No were not.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Monica	Okay, were gonna need a distraction.
Monica	I got it!
Monica	The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!
Monica	A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Monica	Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Monica	Because hell know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a bear thats dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, youre a genius!
Monica	Give it. Give it.
Monica and Rachel	Oh!!
Monica	It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Monica	Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Monica	Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Ben	Monica.
Monica	Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Ben	Monica bang!
Monica	Did he just say Monica bang?
Monica	Oh my God! Hes gonna rat me out!
Ben	Monica bang!
Monica	Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. Its no big deal, its not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang. (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats) Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isnt that fun?
Monica	You okay?
Monica	Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
Rachel	Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!
Ben	Monica.
Ben	Monica bang!
Monica	Oh thats right, thats what Id sound like if I exploded.
Monica	All right, we should call somebody.
Monica	How are we gonna do that? Theres no way.
Rachel	I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Ross	Monica did it?
Ross	Monica?
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	No. Why?
Monica	Really?!
Monica	Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)
Monica	(coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living room)
Ross	Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
Monica	And yet, were still poking him.
Monica	Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Monica	Every year.
Ross	Um, Monica and I arent supposed to play football.
Monica and Ross	Yeah.
Monica	Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the Geller Bowl.
Monica	Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kindve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Rosss nose.
Monica	To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Monica	(to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.
Monica	Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, its been twelve years.
Monica	(shouting) Once!!
Monica	Okay. Lets bring it in.
Monica	Well, why dont we just bunny up.
Monica and Ross	(holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!
Monica	Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Rachel	Monica, Im your best friend.
Monica	Phoebe.
Monica	All right people listen, Ive got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Monica	Huddle up.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Okay, Phoebe you know what youre doing right?
Monica	Okay, Joeys gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Monica	Phoebe, I thought you said you know what youre doing?
Monica	Break.
Monica	Score!! 7 to nothing!
Monica	Losers walk!
Monica and Joey	One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Monica	Come on guys! Lets go! Come on, its second down.
Monica	No its not, its second.
Monica	Wow, what?
Monica	Pulling what? Its second down.
Monica	I heard that!
Monica	All right, come on guys, lets go! Tie score, and were runnin out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica throws the ball to Phoebe.)
Monica	Run, Phoebe, run!
Monica	After the snap!
Monica	Does so count!
Monica	Y'know what, thats fine, maybe you havent grown up, but I have.
Monica	Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)
Monica	No! Listen, Im not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you cant blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Lets just call this, tie score and its halftime.
Monica	Y'know what? Ill think youll play.
Monica	Because the winner gets this!
Monica	When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Monica	No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!
Monica	Come on Phoebe, lets go! Come on, its time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
Monica	All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
Monica	All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, Ill take care of the rest.
Monica	Break!
Monica	Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya dont see that everyday, do ya?
Monica	What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Monica	Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
Monica	Youre so pathetic! Why cant you just accept it, were winning because Im better than you.
Monica	Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, Ill prove it to you, okay. Ill trade you Joey for Rachel, and Ill still win the game.
Ross	What?! The guys against the girls? See, thats ridiculous Monica, because Im only down by three touchdowns.
Monica	Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Ross	Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey youre with me.
Monica	Come on Rach, come on. Lets see whats it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Monica	All right then.
Monica	Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Monica	We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while youre making out...
Monica	Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Lets kill um!
Monica	All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and were down by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Monica	Honey, theres a reason.
Monica	All right Rachel, you sweep behind, Ill pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Monica	Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
Monica	No! Im not okay!
Monica	Come on! Come on! Hurry! Were running out of time! Huddle up!
Monica	All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Monica	Break!
Monica	Let go! Im a tiny little woman!!
Monica	Ow!!
Monica	Let go!
Monica	No!
Monica	I dont know. I guess the other people just dont care enough.
Monica	Let go!
Monica	You broke a little girls leg?!!
Monica	Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Monica	All right, Ill take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and thats it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross) Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Monica	No.
Monica	Dont, dont, dont, dont, dont do this.
Monica	(she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)
Monica	(comes up and starts looking through Rosss cookie supply) Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
Monica	What?
Ross	Monica, Im cutting you off.
Monica	No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-its no big deal, all right, Im-Im cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Monica	(covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)
Monica	Christmas cookie?
Monica	(entering) Hey, guys. Im here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Monica	Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Monica	Oh honey, is that cause your Mom died around Christmas?
Monica	Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a way-to-go thumbs up and smile.)
Joey and Monica	(jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!
Joey	Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Monica	Um-mm.
Monica	Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?
Monica	He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Monica	I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Monica	All right, be my guest.
Monica	Honey, whats the matter?
Monica	Its Joeys birthday.
Monica	Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Monica	I know honey, Im sorry.
Monica	(gives her a look) Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Rachel	(looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?
Gunther	(to Monica and Phoebe) Hey guys.
Monica	Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Monica	I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Monica	Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Monica	(to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.
Chandler	(to Monica) Take off your shirt!
Monica	Oh my!!
Rachel	Hi! So Im out having lunch at Monicas and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdales and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and hes gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Chandler	(to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Monica	How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joeys sisters.
Monica	Hi.
Monica	Isnt that great?
Monica	Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, Hummina-hummina-hummina. (walks away)
Monica	How ya feelin?
Monica	What is the worse part?
Monica	Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead.
Monica	I mean, was it Gina?
Monica	No, no, no, thats Dina.
Chandler	(to Monica) You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Monica	That was me.
Monica	Thats okay.
Monica	Y'know which one was she again?
Monica	No honey, Im sorry, but the weekends not over yet.
Monica	I guess theyre back from their date.
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	I am good. I finished my book.
Monica	I dont remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Monica	Wait a minute, why dont you just call Mark. (they both look up in shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, youve got to make stuff happen.
Monica	(to Ross) Honey, its not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Ross	Thats right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at Monica)
Rachel	(on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, its Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no, dont you apologize. (listens) Yeah, Ill hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Monica	Yay!
Monica	Oh, that is amazing!
Ross	You go get em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Monica	What?
Monica	Are you crazy?!
Monica	What?! Ross y'know this isnt even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if youre right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Monica	I mean dont you trust her?
Monica	Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Monica	So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Monica	Yeah, I do know.
Monica	Y'know if its any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)
Jeannine	(to Monica) All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Monica	Please, I'm not going for anything.
Monica	Would you please go?
Monica	Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Monica	Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Monica	Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it?
Monica	Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I can't believe I just said that.')
Monica	Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write about?
Monica	Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here?
Monica	How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
Monica	(entering) Hi!
Monica	It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
Monica	Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out. (hands them the poem)
Monica	Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
Monica	Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work. (tries to take the poem)
Monica	All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Phoebe	Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
Phoebe	What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
Monica	Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Monica	What do you mean?
Monica	(to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
Monica	Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
Monica	You don't even know me...
Monica	What?
Monica	I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
Monica	(sarcastically) Oh yeah.
Man	(singing) Mister Pretensous, (Monica stands up in the background) you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Monica	(to clerk) Hi.
Monica	Six? I just had it for one night. Its three.
Monica	Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, youre gonna have to help me out here, cause I only have three.
Monica	Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!
Monica	Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.
Monica	Right.
Monica	What?
Monica	(removes them) Thats because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and its static cling. Or maybe its just that God knew Id be running into you and saw an opportunity.
Monica	Its good to see you too.
Monica	You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Me too.
Monica	Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
Monica	No, I just I think that its too soon.
Monica	(entering from her bedroom) Morning.
Monica	Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Monica	Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Monica	Tomorrow night.
Rachel	Monica, what are you doing?
Monica	Its not a date, okay. Im just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Monica	Were not gonna have sex! Okay, nothings changed here. He still doesnt want children and I still do, so thats why were just gonna be friends.
Monica	You say Thank you very much, and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, were gonna put are hands in this bowl, and were gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Monica	You touch peoples eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Richard	Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. (Monica grabs his hand in the tomatoes.) Thats my hand.
Monica	Oops.
Monica	Gotta keep squishing.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Monica	Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it should umm, be.....
Monica	Umm, youve got some on your pants.
Monica	So, howd the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too. (listens) I know. Its hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) Its a word!
Monica	Yeah, I do think its better this way. (listens) Yeah, were being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, Im sure.(she opens the door and its Richard)
Monica	Ill call you back. (starts kissing him)
Monica	So we can be friends who sleep together.
Monica	Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Monica	Oh.
Monica	No! (pushes him) No!
Monica	Cause if you do that means youd be cancelling it for me, and were just friends.
Monica	Hi.
Monica	You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her left breast.) in a grill fire.
Monica	What are you smiling at?
Monica	Yeah, right.
Monica	I love this friend thing!
Monica	Ow!
Monica	Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as Richard starts the tour.)
Richard	The bedroom. Well its pretty much your typical... (opens the door as Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see the room.) bedroom.
Monica	(still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?
Monica	(still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And Im just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Monica	(gets up) Okay, y'know what, Im not fine, Im not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause) Y'know what, what if were friends who dont see other people?
Monica	Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Monica	Thats not true, you dont have a moustache.
Monica	Y'know what, Ive got to walk out of here right now, cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I dont think I could do it again.
Monica	How bout one last game of racquetball?
Monica	Watch the thorns!
Monica	(to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.
Monica, Ross, and Joey	(joining in) Home is Home Star stew.
Phoebe	Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a tissue, please?
Monica	Yeah, sure.
Monica	Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Monica	Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Monica	Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Phoebe and Monica	Hey.
Monica	No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Monica	Yeah, Ginger something.
Monica	No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, (singing) the movie star.
Monica	Well, what did you do?
Monica	Y'know what, dont tell us. Well just wait until Chandler gets home, (to Phoebe) because itll be more fun that way.
Monica	You gave her food poisoning!?
Monica	Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Monica	Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Monica	Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
Monica	Well, dont cha wanna?
Monica	Okay, well I do know you.
Monica	Well so?
Monica	(entering) Hi!
Monica	Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milks gone bad.
Monica	So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Monica	Sounds like shes got the ah, whole package.
Monica	Uh-huh.
Chandler	(to Monica) Actually hes the smallest person in the world.
Monica	Sorry, Pheebs.
Monica	Wed love too.
Monica	Wow! Its like Rachel in High School.
Monica	Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Joey	(to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Monica	I wont give you anything, but youll owe me 2.95.
Monica	Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?
Monica	Okay, lets start with the free messages outside the UN.
Monica	Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Monica	Wheres that?
Monica	I dont have an atlas.
Monica	Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
Monica	Hold on.
Monica	Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)
Monica	Its a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Monica	Oh, no thanks.
Monica	Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Monica	Wow! Its small.
Monica	So you had fun, huh?
Monica	No.
Phoebe and Monica	Hey.
Monica	Oh no, shes still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
Monica	All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. (holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.
Monica	Oh thats my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe) Shes fancy.
Phoebe	(to Monica) Anyway, Im going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translators date? So that when we, its time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, hes really, hes kinda cute.
Monica	Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Monica	Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?
Monica	Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Mischa	(to Monica) So I was wondering....
Mischa	(to Phoebe, very quickly) Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. (to Monica) So you're a chef?
Monica	Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Phoebe	Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What are you doing?
Monica	Well, I was having a conversation.
Monica	What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Mischa	(to Monica) And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Monica	Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?
Mischa	(to Monica) Oh, hes unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! (to Sergei) You silly diplomat, why dont you learn some English, Sergei?
Monica	Hey, the mans dog just died.
Mischa	(to Monica) I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Monica	It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy cant even say coupons. (they leave)
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Hows the big anniversary dinner?
Monica	Ohhh, nice.
Monica	What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and fruit flies everywhere.)
Rachel	(looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica its on the ceiling.
Monica	Thats okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Monica	Oh no!!
Monica	Rachel, you and Mark?!
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Oh, theres banana on it.
Monica	So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)
Monica	Oh, good. Thanks.
Monica	Okay, all right dont judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Monica	Yes! Have you seen it?
Monica	I know!!
Monica	Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Monica	Did that!
Monica	Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Monica	No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Monica	Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.
Monica	Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?
Monica	Ow!
Monica	Ow!! Ow!!
Monica and Phoebe	Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Monica	Its okay, its okay.
Monica	We were just waxing our legs.
Monica	Thats right.
Monica	What?
Monica	(going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.
Monica	Oh my God.
Monica	Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and you didnt tell us?!
Monica	(stopping him) What, what are you doing? You cant go out there.
Monica	Because theyll know weve been listening.
Chandler	(handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, were never leaving, ever.
Monica	What if they dont?
Monica	Hey. Its three in the morning. They dont know that Ive come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Ross	Okay, well here we are. Now were in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And Im sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I cant. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just cant see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Monica	Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Monica	No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Monica	Its never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Monica	(seeing her) Okay, lets go!! Lets hit the road!!
Monica	Lets get the show on it!
Monica	Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and its sooo close.
Monica and Phoebe	Hey!
Monica	Were sorry honey.
Monica	Very bad.
Monica	Chandler!!
Monica	Werent you nine?!
Monica	Were really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Monica	Noo! Ill stay. Hes my brother.
Monica	No! Were gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Joey	(to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Monica	Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
Monica	No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Monica	What?
Monica	Ow!
Monica	(getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Monica	So, if youre parents hadnt got divorced, youd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Monica	What?!
Monica	Please!!
Phoebe	Okay, Monicas are the biggest.
Monica	These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, its gotta be Rachel.
Monica	All right then, your bra would still be big.
Chandler	Ladies, ladies, lets just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monicas bra.
Monica	Chandler!!
Phoebe	Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.
Monica	Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Phoebe	(to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?
Monica	Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Monica	So the going for help went well?
Monica	Then why are you smoking?
Monica	(running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)
Monica	(reading the sign) Whats pleh?
Monica	Huh. Whats doofus spelled backwards?
Phoebe	(to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and were then gonna go skiing?
Monica	I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Monica	Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Monica	Here we go again.
Ross	Hey-hey, its valid okay? And Im not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
Rachel	(to Monica) What?!
Monica	(shyly) I dont know.
Monica	What I said was, was that I understood. Joeys the one who agreed with you!
Ross	(to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Monica	All right, well call you when we get back.
Monica	(to Joey) Whats so funny?
Monica	Oh. (she laughs)
Chandler	Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)
Monica	Yeah, ah, but Pheebs dont you think hes a little young to get married?
Monica	So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Monica	And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Monica	(to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?
Monica	Havent you and I covered that topic?
Monica	Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Monica	I mean really, think about it.
Monica	Nah, he doesnt do anything for me.
Rachel	Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?
Monica	Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids. (realises) All right, I get your point.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Uh, yeah.
Monica	Here you go.
Monica	As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so Id call him.
Monica	Thats Bill Clinton.
Monica	Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?
Rachel	Oh my God, Monicas gonna go out with a millionaire.
Monica	Im not gonna go out with him.
Monica	Or incredibly offensive.
Secretary	You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Pete	Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. (Monica enters) Hi.
Monica	What the hell is this? (holding up the check)
Monica	Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Monica	Youre supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, whats-whats the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Monica	What?!
Monica	Okay, umm, youre a loon.
Monica	I dont know.
Monica	Cause I dont want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Monica	Guys, please, Im just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Monica	I know!!
Monica	(opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!
Monica	And thats why, Im not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) Bye.
Monica	(in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?
Monica	Oh, thats sounds great.
Monica	Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Monica	Why, how much is that?
Monica	Oh, this is so great.
Monica	All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.
Monica	Hello, people who do not live here.
Monica	I gave you a key for emergencies!
Monica	Hes great! I mean we have such a good time together! Hes so funny, and sooo sweet, and Im not attracted to him at all!!
Monica	Noo!! Its driving me crazy. I mean every other way hes like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Monica	Two.
Monica and Phoebe	Oh.
Pete	(to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Monica	Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future? Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?!
Rachel	Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!
Pete	(to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?
Monica	Sure.
Monica	(looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, Im gonna say, midget rodeo.
Monica	Okay. Umm, y'know, I dont think, I dont think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Monica	So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isnt the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now Im just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Monica	I so wanna be attracted to you.
Monica	Im sorry.
Monica	Its not?
Pete	I know Im no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone who find attractive, Im just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Monica	Well, um, look I-I dont want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasnt attracted too.
Pete	(to Monica) One second.
Monica	Hey, Rach, how was work?
Monica	By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Monica	Something wrong?
Monica	Wow, youre really crazy about her, huh?
Ross	Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Monica	Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Monica	Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And Im sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Monica	I get the dollhouse!
Monica	Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Monica	Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Monica	Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpapers a little faded, thats okay. Carpets a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Phoebe	Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful.
Monica	I know!!!
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Whats this?
Monica	Not one that can pee on the roof.
Monica	I dont want a ghost.
Monica	Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-thats it, thats it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? Theyre not the right size, theyre not Victorian, and they just dont go.
Monica	Its very interesting, Phoebe.
Monica	Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Joey	(to Monica) Hey.
Monica	Youre kidding?! Thats great!
Monica	Oh my.
Monica	Come on Rach, when a guy says hes going to call, it doesnt mean hes going to call. Hasnt it ever happened to you?
Monica	Hmm, bite me.
Monica	(from the bathroom) Im in the shower!
Monica	Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Monica	(runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.
Monica	Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.
Monica	Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Monica	That was you?!
Joey	(leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is moaning in pain.) Oh my.
Monica	Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to skate over to him)
Monica	Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip?
Monica	Oh, whatd ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Monica	(popping back up) Regular or decaf?
Monica	Okay. (hands him a cup)
Monica	So what did you do today Pete?
Monica	What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)
Monica	Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Monica	I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monicas Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But Petes just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Monica	Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I cant. I couldnt even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Monica	Oh, please.
Monica	What? Honey.
Monica	Oh God, Im so sorry.
Monica	Oh God!
Ross	(to Monica) You like it right?
Monica	Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. (Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! Im kidding!
Monica	What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Monica	Okay. Heres the thing.
Monica	I cant do it. Im sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Monica	Huh?
Monica	Oh?
Monica	Oh, thats great! I mean Im-Im sorry, but Im so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Monica	Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him on the cheek) All right, y'know what? Im just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
Monica	Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?
Monica	(rolling towards the office) Im quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the door the other way.) Im okay!! Im all right!!
Phoebe	Cause youre still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Hey, guess what Im doing tonight.
Monica	Im checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Phoebe	Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Monica	I know.
Monica	What?
Monica	Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Monica	Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Monica	Does it have to do with Joey?
Monica	Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Monica	Does it involve travel?
Monica	Does it involve clogs?
Monica	Clogs.
Monica	Claws?!
Monica	Okay, so it doesnt involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
Monica	What is it?! What about Pete?
Phoebe	I dont know! (frantically points at Monica)
Monica	Okay, I feel like Im talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
Monica	Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)
Monica	Okay, does it involve something to do with Petes computer company?
Monica	I dont believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! Its gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! Id be cold, but Im always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Monica	Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs him)
Monica	Did you just smell my hair?
Monica	Oh God.
Monica	You still have feelings for me dont you?
Monica	Pete.
Monica	No, its not bad. Its not bad at all. Its-its really nice.
Monica	You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. Thats why I cant take this job.
Monica	And well, we probably shouldnt see each other anymore. Im sorry.
Monica	Okay, bye.
Monica	All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (She kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and kiss, very passionately.)
Monica	I need two. Im bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Monica	Really? Whos number two?
Monica	Bye-bye!
Monica	Joey, what are you doing?! Its never gonna happen, shes seeing somebody.
Monica	(to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)
Monica	Uh-huh.
Phoebe	Okay. (on phone) Ooh, Im setting the phone down. (does so) But Im still here! Just dont go anywhere Im still here. (starts to put on the sweater) Dont-dont switch or anything, cause Im, Im right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.) Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just
Monica	Phoebe?
Phoebe	What?! Monica, Im scared!!
Monica	All right. Honey, thats-thats a sleeve. Okay?
Monica	And! We also have speaker phone. (She turns on the speaker phone.)
Monica	Okay, wait, you gotta hang up cause were gonna be late.
Monica	Of course not.
Monica	Theres our star!
Monica	Hi!
Monica	Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Estelle	How do you do. (to Rachel and Monica) Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! (to Joey) Did they have representation?
Estelle	Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face (points to Monica) and her chest (points to Rachel) I could really put something together.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Yeah. Where were you?
Monica	You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Phoebe	Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
Monica	(entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, youve been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isnt healthy.
Monica	Hey! Didnt you have that outfit on last night?
Monica	Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Monica	Joey, you had the night!
Monica	When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Monica	Did you like learn about her family?
Monica	Yes!!
Monica	Oh! (They hug, triumphantly.)
Monica	One.
Chandler	7:15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesnt work.
Ross	No, its not just cause Im jealous. (Both Monica and Chandler give him a Come on look) I mean Im not, Im not, Im not jealous, okay? Its Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Monica	Were kidding!
Monica; Ross	Monica; Ross!
Monica	Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Monica	Phoebe, its been two days.
Monica	What?
Monica	(sarcastic) Oh.
Monica	Pete's breaking up with me.
Monica	I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
Monica	Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Monica	Really?!
Monica	(starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Monica	Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Monica	Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Monica	No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Monica	I know.
Monica	Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically answers it)
Pete	Monica? (the gang ducks and hides)
Monica	I guess that's how.
Pete	Hey Monica, how's it going.
Monica	Oh its umm, good! It's umm, its good, just here watering the plants.
Monica	Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Monica	Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Pete	Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. (to other caller) Yeah. (listens) Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. (pause) Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
Monica	Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
Monica	I love you.
Monica	Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
Joey	(looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Monica	Oh my.
Rachel	Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Monica	And that's Pete's Mom.
Monica	Would you stop? Weve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we dont even know if hes gonna propose.
Monica	Well if-if thats what it is, then its-its crazy.
Ross	Monicas right. Were talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she cant just rush into this.
Monica	Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Monica	Brides magazines?
Monica	It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant. Right? I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Monica	I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)
Monica	So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Monica	Ooh, nice.
Monica	Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Monica	Yeah?
Monica	Wow.
Monica	Whats that?
Monica	Okay. (not sure of herself)
Pete	Monica, I want to become (pause) the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Monica	You wanna what?!
Monica	What are you talking about?
Monica	And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Pete	Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Monica	My parents will be so happy.
Monica	(entering) Hey.
Monica	Youre not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Monica	So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
Monica	(Robin is speaking loudly again) I...
Monica	Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)
Phoebe	So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
Monica	(pause) I have no idea.
Rachel	So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
Monica	He didnt ask me to marry him.
Monica	He wanted to tell me hes gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Monica	I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.
Monica	Yeah, but without the costumes.
Monica	So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?
Monica	Whats fish hooking?
Monica	I gotta tell ya, I think its okay to be that guy.
Rachel	Y'know I dont, I dont understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin her boob.
Monica	Okay, can we please go eat?
Monica	(to Chandler) Anything but stew.
Chandler	(to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
Monica	(entering) Hi!
Pete	Monica! (runs over and kisses her) Hi honey.
Monica	Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I dont want you to get hurt, cause I kinda like you.
Monica	Promise me youll be careful.
Monica	Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Monica	Okay, good, cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
Monica	How bout just a boom?
Monica	God Ross, what is that?
Monica	I love you, Pete!!!
Monica	(going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guys pretty huge!
Monica	Hey! (she sits down next to him) Its me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Monica	I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Monica	Well, youre not gonna get going are you?
Monica	Well, no. But...
Monica	That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Monica	You didnt know that already?
Monica	Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.
Monica	Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Monica	(joining them) Hey.
Monica	Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Monica	Four, please. (Ross looks at her) Im really nervous. (Ross gives her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)
Monica	Please tell me youre stopping now.
Monica	You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Monica	Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Monica	Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then youre gonna have to do it without me.
Monica	Then Ive gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)
Pete	Mon-Monica?
Monica	Yes?
Joey	Check it out, hes winning! (to Monica) Petes winning!
Monica	Really?!
Rachel	(to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Monica	Joey, she was listing the countries shes done it in.
Monica	(watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Monica	(sarcastic) Thanks!
Monica	Yeah right.
Monica	You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Monica	Well, no. Youre Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)
Monica	Well Id probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Monica	Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Chandler, Monica, and Joey	Hey!!
Monica	Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Monica	Whats with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the floor, which is covered in sand)
Monica	What?!
Monica	What are you crazy?!
Rachel	(to Monica) Allll done!
Monica	Aww, thank you.
Monica	(to Phoebe) So whats Phoebe like?
Phoebe	Im kind, caring, and sweet. Whats Monica like?
Monica	Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
Monica	Oh well, where is he?!
Phoebe	She was acting, she was pretending like she hasnt heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look (shows Monica)! Isnt this what he would look like now?
Monica	(gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.)
Monica	Well, why would she lie to you?
Monica	Strip Happy Days Game?
Phoebe	Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasnt happened yet, but were all very excited.
Monica	I think Ill help her out. (She gets up to go over and help Rachel, and reveals she has no pants.) (to Rachel) What is going on here?
Monica	You painting his toenails?
Monica	Chasing him all around the room?
Rachel	Monica, please?
Monica	Hes totally flirting with you too.
Monica	Huh?
Monica	You didnt even take off your pants.
Monica	What?
Monica	Like a log.
Monica	Thats that weird voice again.
Chandler	Hi! Im Dorf! Youre date for the evening. (Monica walks away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, thats good stuff!!
Joey	(voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler...
Chandler	(to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust)
Monica	(closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! Were out of soda.
Monica	Really?!
Monica	Sweety, what are you talking about?
Phoebe	(turning around, insistently) Monica!
Monica	Oh.
Monica	Ennnh.
Joey	(jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Monica	(screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!
Monica	Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Monica	Its like two miles!
Monica	Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Monica	What?! What is it?!
Monica	What?!! Gross!!
Monica	Well forget it! It doesnt hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!
Monica	Nothing, I dont know.
Monica	Nothing. Im gonna take a shower.
Monica	Pass the cheese, please.
Monica	My God, you cant even look at me! Can you?
Chandler, Monica, and Joey	NO!!!
Monica	What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Monica	(stopping him) No! Joey, we swore wed never tell!
Chandler	(running over and joining Monica) Theyll never understand!
Joey	Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! Its eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Monica	(interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldnt stand. I-I couldnt walk.
Chandler	(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didnt think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monicas shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
Monica	I was in too much pain.
Ross	Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Monica	You cant say that!! You-you dont know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldnt...bend that way. So... (looks at Joey.)
Chandler	(entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
Monica	You bet.
Ross	It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means you are, Y-O-U-R means your!
Rachel	Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when youre at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Monica	Hey!!
Rachel	(to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep youre gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Monica	(sets down some cards) Gin.
Monica	Will you stop!
Monica	Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Chip	(on machine) Hey Monica, its Chip.
Monica	Yesss!!
Monica	Shhh!
Monica	Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Monica	Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Ross	Monica, youre so lucky! Hes like the most popular guy in school!!
Monica	I know!! (calls him) (on phone) Chip? Hi! Its Monica. (listens) Kay. (listens) Kay. (listens) Okay. (listens) Okay, good-bye. (hangs up) Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as Rachel enters)
Rachel	(on phone) Chip! Hi, its Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens) Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh.
Ross	(whispering in her ear) Oh, thats right! He called to ask out Monica! That-thats gotta be embarrassing!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Monica	What, that little thing at the prom?
Rachel	Monica! I couldnt find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Monica	Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Monica	Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Monica	You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Monica	It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Monica	Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Monica	Oh, really?!
Monica	Ill try.
Monica	Why cant you use the phone in here?
Phoebe	Well, Im returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monicas room)
Monica	Ross, dont start.
Monica	Oh, but its made her so happy.
Monica	He is right, isnt he?
Monica	Hi!
Monica	(sliding into Joeys place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe) Huh? Whatd ya say Joe? Ill be right there. (gets up and joins Joey)
Monica	(running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)
Chip	So ah, Monica ready yet?
Chip	Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
Monica	Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Monica	Thats what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and youre Chip. Nevermind.
Monica	Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Monica	Umm. Well, theres Rachel, and umm, I think thats it. How bout you?
Monica	Is that all?
Monica	Ohh, how is he?
Monica	Isnt he an architect now?
Monica	Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I dont even know where you work?
Monica	I do?
Monica	You still work at the multiplex?
Monica	Thanks, Im set. Do you still live with your parents?
Monica	(entering) Oh my God! What happened?
Rachel	(to Monica) So, how was your date?
Monica	Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Monica	Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Monica	No, its okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Monica	I know!
Monica	Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel	Thats a good call. Right.
Monica	Me too. (they all leave)
Monica	(Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?
Monica	I just told my Mom Id cater a party for her.
Monica	Because I need the money, and I thought that itd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Monica	You dont have to stick up for her. She cant here you.
Monica	Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Monica	Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Monica	Let me ask you a question.
Monica	Why did you hire me?
Monica	(to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks Im good.
Monica	Oh yeah, she didnt hire me out of pity, it wasnt so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks Im good.
Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Rachel	Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Monica	I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod Yes.)
Monica	What?
Monica	Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldnt give me grief about me biting them.
Monica	(Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put (realises) Oh my God! Its in the quiche! Oh My God!
Mrs. Geller	(entering) (to Monica) Honey, dont bite your nails.
Monica	Okay ah, please dont freak out. Umm, but ah, theres a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and theres no way to know which one.
Monica	Then why are you laughing?
Monica	What? You bet Id lose a nail?
Monica	Frozen lasagnas?
Monica	You bet that Id screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was
Mrs. Geller	No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
Monica	You promised Dr. Weinburg, youd never use that phrase.
Monica	(laughs) Thats right. My Mom doesnt have any faith in me! Oh, thats hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Monica	(interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an awkward silence follows.)
Monica	Hi.
Monica	Ohh, Im such an idiot. I cant believe I actually thought she could change.
Phoebe	Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Monica	Oh good, Im glad thats catching on.
Phoebe	No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and well call that pulling a Monica.
Monica	What?
Phoebe	Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight As, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that ones outta here." Though some things dont change.
Monica	(getting up) All right, Ill go down there. But, Im not gonna serve the lasagna. Im gonna serve something I make.
Phoebe	Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins Monica.)
Rachel	I have so got it. Theres gonna be rumours about this, theres no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Chandler	How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Monica	Well?
Monica	Really?!
Monica	Yes!!
Monica	And you?
Monica	So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you
Monica	Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Monica	Wow!
Phoebe	Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both look at her) (to Monica) She doesnt know we switched it. (Monica nods her head No.)
Monica	That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, dont bite your nails.
Monica	(in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)
Monica	Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Monica	Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? (Joey is pissed)
Monica	Rachel!
Monica	You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Monica	Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)
Monica	Third door on the left.
Monica	God! If youre gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.
Monica	Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.
Monica	(Picking up a card from Chandlers wallet.) My God! Is this a gym card?
Mr. Treeger	: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. Ive been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I dont need this grief. Im gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmothers apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
Monica	Whats the matter?
Monica	So do them for free.
Monica	Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Monica	Youre gonna do some feet flirtin!
Monica	What a minute, what did he say?
Monica	I told you not to go down there!
Monica	Rachel always cries!
Monica	Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like youve never sucked before!
Joey	All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns around) I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)
Joey	Please dont kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasnt there fault, it was mine.
Monica	His dancing partner?!
Monica	Oh, would you let it go already?! Youre fine!
Monica	Wait, now so you joined the gym?
Monica	Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Monica	Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Monica	Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Monica	Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Monica	(laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!
Monica	All right, then show me some manly moves.
Monica	So you didnt leave the bank?
Monica	Oh my Gosh!
Monica	Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Monica	Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Monica	Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Monica	That cold makes you sound so great.
Monica	Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Monica	(turning around and doing that, "I'm making out with someone," thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)
Monica	Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Rachel's not here.
Monica	How's it going with her?
Monica	Hi, Josh.
Monica	So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Monica	Very!
Ross	Monica knows.
Monica	It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Ross	Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Monica	Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Ross	Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)
Monica	Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
Monica	(sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Phoebe	You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Monica	(lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.
Rachel	Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!
Monica	What?
Monica	Why?
Phoebe	(to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Monica	Thank you so much Phoebe.
Phoebe	(picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.
Monica	What are you doing with those?!
Monica	Sorry, Phoebe.
Monica	Umm. (nodding her head, "Good.")
Monica	Ohhhh!! Gross!!
Ross	(entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Monica	No, sorry.
Monica	Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Monica	Ross, cough drops, please?
Monica	(interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Monica	And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Monica	That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Monica	Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Monica	(Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Monica	Sixty guests.
Monica	Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Phoebe	Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
Monica	I don't know.
Monica	Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
Monica	Well, you're not working either.
Monica	Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you! [Joey enters]
Rachel	And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love." [cut to a new scene, also in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting, Phoebe is nearby.]
Phoebe	Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language. [Monica enters]
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrowthe dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Monica	Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. (Picks up two frying pans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Monica	Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But lookI've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Monica	Okay.Scene: Outside Cheryl's apartment, Ross and Cheryl are kissing]
Cheryl	Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.Scene: A kitchen where Phoebe and Monica are finishing up a catering job]
Monica	Oh, is everything in the car?
Monica	No. I hate this part.
Monica	No, that's not mine.
Phoebe	Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took! [cut to the living room of the same dwelling, where the funeral guests are mingling. Monica enters.]
Monica	Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Monica	Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Monica	Just the matter of ...payment?
Joey	Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.Scene: Back in the kitchen at the funeral. Phoebe is there, Monica enters.]
Monica	Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
Monica	What?
Monica	Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Monica	Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me. [cut to the living room where Mrs. Burkart is now performing.]
Joey	All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure) Oink!Scene: Monica and Rachel, Rachel is there, Chandler enters.]
Monica	Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Phoebe	Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica with everyone staring at her.)
Monica	I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.Scene: Outside Cheryl's apartment.
Gunther	Move! [Gunther slips and falls just before reaching the back of the couch. Monica and Phoebe come into Central Perk.
Monica	Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Monica	Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Monica	And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Monica	Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Monica	I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Joey	Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Monica	Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Monica	Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it? [Cheryl shrugs, shuts the door, looking puzzled]
Monica	No? [Monica looks around the hallway, pulls out a sponge and starts scrubbing the door frame.]
Monica	Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Monica	He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	(At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm terrific.
Monica	Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Monica	(to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, theres a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Phoebe	(pushing Monica back onto the couch) Its so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Monica	(to Phoebe) Hey, arent you up next?
Monica	Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Monica	Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Ross	Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you dont want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Monica	Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Monica	Are you serious?
Monica	You obviously havent screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all look at her) Which we all appreciate.
Monica	He loves you.
Monica	I remember you did.
Monica	(removing ear plugs) What?
Monica	Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Phoebe	Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and theres the added mystery of who gets who.
Monica	We havent eaten yet!
Chandler	Oh thats not true! Thats not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it (notices the look on Monica and Phoebes faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials
Monica	Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Monica	Who cares? He works in a museum!
Monica	What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!
Monica	Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
Chandler	Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Monica	Oh, yknow what, I cant, it really kills.
Monica	No, my eye doctor is Richard! I cant go to him when I dont have a boyfriend!
Monica	Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.
Phoebe	(on phone) Hi! Yeah, Im calling on behalf of Monica Gellers eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) Hes out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Monica	Yes!!
Phoebe	This is so cool, til Monica gets back, its like Im head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)
Ross	So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but Im already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Monica	Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Monica	Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Monica	I was probably waiting for it to open.
Monica	You look great too.
Monica	So how does it look?
Monica	Like a pirate?!
Monica	Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Monica	Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Monica	No way!
Monica	(disappointed) Oh.
Monica	(happy) Oh.
Monica	(sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirates voice) So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
Monica	I know.
Monica	Why is it sick?
Monica	Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand dont you?
Monica	Me going out with Richards son.
Monica	Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian, (points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girls wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler) livin in a box!! (goes to her room)
Monica	(running in from her bedroom) Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.
Monica	Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Monica	And Joey.
Monica	My brother, Ross.
Monica	And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And thats Chandler.
Monica	Umm, well, hes
Monica	All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Monica	Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Monica	See hes nice. Right?
Phoebe	Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "Thats not how your dad used to do it."
Monica	I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)
Monica	Oh-ho-ho, weve got company.
Monica	(putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)
Monica	Thank you.
Monica	Yknow all my friends think this is weird.
Monica	I know! I mean its like me and your dad, thats a totally separate thing.
Monica	Were just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Monica	Nothing. Nothing.
Monica	No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss
Monica	(interrupting) Dont say it!
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	I know!
Monica	Oh, hes catching up to her!
Monica	Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands over their eyes.)
Monica	All right, umm, were not gonna really keep it this way though.
Monica	(to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Monica	Well, Im gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Monica	Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence dozens of people.
Monica	Oh no-no-no, its only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
Phoebe	Oh, in that case(hops up and down in joy)Yay! (Monica looks confused) That was me hopping on board.
Monica	Oh.
Monica	All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Monica	Hey! My first review is out!
Monica	All right, look at my on the back page.
Phoebe	Oh, okay! (reading) "Would I go back to Allesandros? Sure, but Id have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.
Monica	Hey, they dont pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Monica	Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Monica	Havent we made this decision?
Monica	Bye!
Monica	(answering it) Who is it?
Monica	Oh my God.
Monica	Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!
Monica	Look, I-Im never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Monica	No! Phoebe!
Phoebe	Hey, Monica!
Monica	I couldnt eat it! I had five friends who couldnt eat it, and one of them eats books.
Monica	The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Monica	All right, that Ill retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it. Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Monica	Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Monica	Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Monica	Okay, the owner of Allesandros came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Monica	Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Monica	You got the job?! Why didnt you tell me?
Rachel	Ohh, its gonna be so great! Im gonna get to help decide what we sell, Im gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica) Im gonna have walls!
Monica	Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Monica	I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like its snowballing, yknow?
Monica	I got offered the head chef job at Allesandros.
Monica	Its okay, cause y'know what? You dont really need me for the business.
Monica	All right. But umm, I-I-Ill pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
Monica	Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)
Monica	(entering) Ohh, here you are. Yknow, Im-Im glad you decided to hear me out.
Monica	Ive been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Monica	Or! A bakery delivery person.
Monica	Pizza?!
Phoebe	Monica!
Monica	All right, Ive got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, Im getting the feeling that you dont want to deliver.
Monica	Okay. Im guessing that if you dont want to deliver, you probably dont want to pick stuff up either.
Monica	Yknow what, lets do the catering business.
Monica	Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Yknow what, itd be, itd be fun.
Phoebe	Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, lets plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.) Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) Yknow what, I want you to take the chef job.
Monica	Really?!
Monica	Thank you.
Allesandro	Im so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, its like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much were gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Monica	Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?
Monica	Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Monica	I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chefs hat. (The hat says Quit, bitch)
Rachel	Hey, honey! Whats the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Monica	I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica glares at him.)
Monica	I mean theyre trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something Ive been waiting for my whole life.
Monica	I would love too, but I cant! I mean I just cant, you know that Im not good at confrontation.
Monica	Thats a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Monica	All right, youre hired!
Monica, Rachel, and Joey	Yes!
Phoebe	(singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Monica	Didnt your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Monica	(getting up) All right, Im gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Monica	You want a problem? Ill give you a problem!
Monica	You bet your ass, Im gonna fire you! Thank you.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	They baked it. I cant take this anymore. Im gonna call a meeting tonight, Im gonna fire you tonight.
Monica	What are you doing?!
Monica	Thanks. (Joeys still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!
Monica	Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Monica	Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?
Monica	Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Monica	Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right heres the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere
Monica	(louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at the money hes holding, and doesnt speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Monica	What the hell happened?!
Monica	Joey, we had a deal. That-thats why youre here! Ive got to fire you!
Monica	What kinda things have you been saying?
Phoebe	(singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry
Monica	I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me some more swordfish?
Monica	You did a minute ago!
Monica	Fine!
Monica	Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, Im cold! (She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door opens)
Monica	Thats not funny.
Monica	(starting to cry) Im a good person. And Im a good chef, and I dont deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Yknow what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is
Monica	You do?
Monica	Well if you want a problem? Ill give you a problem!
Monica	You bet your ass Im gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Monica	How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think its funny now?
Monica	Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!
Monica	Thanks.
Monica	Enough!
Phoebe	(singing) "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along. No, don't sing along. Monica, Monica, have a happy Chanukah. Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross. And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"
Monica	No, you messed it up. Youre stupid.
Chandler, Monica, and Rachel	Great!! Thats great!
Monica	Are you serious?
Monica	What did you tell them?
Monica	Yeah, like youre gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
Monica	We just want you to think it through.
Monica	I am so jealous.
Monica	In the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sex and talking and
Monica	And the sex?
Monica	Then what is it?
Monica	So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.
Monica	Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
Monica	Yeah, you should.
Monica	Go on.
Monica	I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	What?!
Monica	(to Chandler) So, did you do it?
Monica	Uh-oh, it was bad?
Monica	Well, it was the first time. Yknow, theres not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Monica	All right, Im gonna show you something a lot of guys dont know. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) All right. Now
Monica	Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out theres more than three), five, six, and seven!
Rachel	Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.
Monica	Its kind of an important one!
Monica	(continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Monica	All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit em all, and you mix em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Monica	All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)
Monica	Yknow, I never saw that.
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	Its gonna be so great.
Monica	Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Monica	What if I asked?
Monica	Really?
Monica	No.
Rachel	What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joeys with Monica in trail.)
Monica	Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Monica	What kind of changes?
All	Good-bye! Good luck! (She opens the door to reveal Monica and Joey.)
Monica	Oh, good luck.
Joey	Good luck. (to Monica) And Im still right!
Monica	That is sooo not true!
Monica	I justI cant believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Deal!
Monica	Ha-ha!
Monica	Aww, man!
Monica	That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Monica	Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Monica	Are you scared?
Monica	Ross will do it.
Monica	You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Ross	What is Monicas biggest pet peeve?
Monica	Same category?
Monica	Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
Ross	Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
Monica	No!!
Monica	I knew that! Rachel! Use youre head!
Monica	Viva Las Gaygas!
Monica	You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Monica	Huh, wanna bet?
Monica	How about we play for more money, say 150?
Monica	Youre doing it again.
Rachel	Monica, I dont want to lose 200 dollars.
Monica	We wont. (to Chandler) 300?
Rachel	Monica?!
Monica	Im just trying to spice it up!
Monica	I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Monica	Deal!
Rachel	Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this.
Monica	Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)
Monica	No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Monica	Come on!
Ross	You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it (Chandler stops jumping)now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Ross	Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Ross	Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Monica	Come on!
Monica	Sandwiches!
Monica	Maurice.
Monica	And processing.
Monica	Its umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Monica	Thats not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
Monica	NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Joey	I call Monicas room!
Chandler	You cant just call Monicas room.
Monica	Man, I feel like Im coming down with something.
Monica	Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you cant guess what color my tonsils are? Ill bet the apartment!
Monica	How do you feel?
Monica	Really?! How much?!
Monica	Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we wouldve made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Monica	All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, its all your fault.
Monica	Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
Monica	Well?
Monica	Its only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Monica	Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Monica	Ill take care of it.
Monica	I lost our mattresses.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Hey, dont mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Monica	Hey, we would still be living here if hadnt gotten the question wrong!
Monica	I cant find garbage bags!
Monica	What is it?!
Monica	I cant believe were living here!
Monica	Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Monica	Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)throw your purses at it.
Monica	Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Monica	Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Monica	If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now. (She takes back the turkey leg)
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	(entering) Hey!
Monica	You made pancakes?
Monica	Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her pancakes.)
Joey	No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin closer.
Monica	Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Monica	The players.
Monica	(laughs) Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is.
Rachel	(on the phone) Monica, Im quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didnt even buy it! (Pause) Im telling you Im quitting! Thats it! Im talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
Monica	Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Monica	Please, have some!
Monica	Yeah, Ive just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Monica	Yeah, its just something I picked up.
Monica	Wait! Wait! This isnt take-out!
Monica	No, wait, please dont go! Ive got porn for you too!
Monica	People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Monica	Im the hostess! Not those guys! Im always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Monica	Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But Im-Im done now. Theyve suffered enough.
Monica	All right then, when Im done with this place, its gonna be ten times better than that place!
Monica	Are you sure?
Monica	Nah, I got it.
Monica	(entering) Okay, its ready. Come on.
Monica	Just come.
Rachel	Wow! Monica!
Monica	Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
Monica	You used to have carpet.
Monica	So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? Im just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
Monica	Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. Im always the hostess.
Monica	(not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, whats this?
Joey	(examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the sandwich)
Monica	Hey, Joey, I dont think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean its only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Monica	Whats Phase Two?
Ross	Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)
Monica	You stink!
Rachel	Hey, Monica!
Monica	Uh-oh, whats the matter?
Monica	I dont know sweetie.
Monica	I cant! I have to work!
Monica	No, Chandlers still in Phase One, and Joeys that thing you smell.
Monica	I think shes here.
Monica	(looking out the peephole) Ohh, shes looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you cant see people through that little hole, can you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!
Woman	Hello! (Monica screams)
Rachel	Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.) Emily?
Monica	I-I-I think you look great.
Monica	What?
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
Monica	Yeah. Run ten blocks, thatll help the smell.
Monica	So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Monica	What?
Monica	So you hit her in the face?
Monica	Hey! Youre wearing pants!
Monica	Its 9:30 in the morning!
Monica	Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!
Monica	Oh-oh, my God!
Monica	(to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?
Monica	Hes with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
Monica	He had to go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Monica	Why do you care so much anyway?
Monica	Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Monica	A couple of days.
Monica	What are you doing?! Chandler! You cant just go back a phase!
Monica	Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Monica	(coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
Monica	Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancers hot pants) so good.
Monica	(to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Monica	Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Monica	I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)
Monica	So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Monica	What, he doesnt like Josh?
Monica	Yeah. And yknow, if you wanna cry, thats okay too.
Monica	Come on! Chandler!
Monica	They really were pretty, werent they? (Rachel and Phoebe both agree)
Monica	Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Monica	Yknow, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is intrigued.) Itd, itd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Monica	Oh, Chantal!
Monica	Really?!
Monica	Thats-thats not Phase Three.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Monica	Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Monica	Didnt it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Monica	They wouldnt have put it there if it didnt do something! How can you not care?
Monica	Janice?!
Monica	How have you been?
Monica	Done?
Monica	This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them dont work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Monica	Yeah, well, Im using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises its Joey.)
Monica	He asked you out?!
Monica	Saucy!
Monica	Electrical plans for the building.
Monica	I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Monica	Hi!
Monica	Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think?
Monica	No-no-no, no!
Monica	I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Monica	Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Monica	I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Monica	No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Monica	But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Monica	All right. The super couldnt figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did. Ive had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Monica	I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Monica	What is it hon?
Monica	Aww, honey Im sorry.
Monica	I dont know how museums work in England but, here, youre not supposed to take stuff.
Monica	Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Ross	(interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.
Ross	Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monicas knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)
Monica	You changed?
Monica	And lucky means, more cleavage?
Monica	Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
Monica	Or Spin the Bottle?
Monica	Two in a row! Youve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss again.)
Monica	Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Monica	Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I cant let(pause), actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Rachel	Im fine! Im fine! Im just losing a tooth, its no big deal. I have a dentist! Yknow. Im gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?
Monica	I think youre done.
Rachel	Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monicas photo albums, I mean you dont do that if youre just in it for two weeks.
Monica	Well at least, Im going to mute it.
Monica	Hi!
Rachel	Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Hi.
Monica	Oh. Why didnt you take her?
Monica	You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Monica	Hey, cheer up! Youre gonna see her again, right?
Monica	(interrupting him) No-no-no, dont-dont do the accent. Youve got to see her again.
Monica	Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Monica	No! Yknow, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Monica	Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Monica	Do you love her?
Monica	You love her!
Monica	Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. Youre probably just gonna catch her just as shes about to go to the gate. Youre gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And shes gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Monica	Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in (Ross looks at her.) Ive been watching too much porn.
Monica	Where ya going?
Monica	How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Monica	Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Monica	And well, what did she say?
Monica	Oh, youre totally welcome! Whatd she say?
Monica	It is not over! Youre over!
Monica	You know!
Monica	It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldnt, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?
Monica	Are you sure?
Monica	This isnt how its supposed to go, there cant be another guy.
Monica	Of course theres another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Monica	You have to go to London!
Monica	Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Monica	When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Monica	You sat back and let him have her, you didnt fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Monica	All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Monica	Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Dont let her go without a fight!
Monica	All right.
Monica	Okay, good luck!
Monica	Thats sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Monica	Hello.
Monica	Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
Monica	All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
Monica	Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesnt show up by then, then just come on home.
Monica	What are you doing here? You cant be here!
Monica	Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I was right! (Points to Emily) Im right, right?
Monica	Oh.
Monica	Yknow what? It really creeps me out choosing other peoples sex clothes.
Monica	Um-hmm.
Monica	Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Monica	Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it, then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Monica	So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Monica	Oh, no!
Rachel	No, its all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there heads in agreement.)
Monica	Emilys straight.
Monica	This totally makes sense!
Monica	Oh, sure it does! In high school, you werent jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Monica	This is so much fun!
Monica	Look, all were trying to say is, dont let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Monica	Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Rachel	Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Monica	Yknow what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Shut up! This place is a hole!
Monica	(entering) Hey!
Monica	Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Monica	Yeah, apparently, theyre pretty good seats.
Monica	Yeah, what, do you think were stupid?
Monica	What do you say?
Monica	Have you even had a girl up here?
Monica	(entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Monica	All right, so what do you say?
Monica	Oh, just do it!!
Phoebe	Oh, well, it doesnt have a nameoh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesnt have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Monica	Theyre green?
Monica	Thats not even a game!
Monica	You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Monica	Oh, good.
Monica	Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.
Monica	Because we won our apartment back!
Monica	No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
Monica	But, we pick again! We pick again!
Monica	I dont know!
Monica	Well discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)
Monica	No, were not! Were not leaving!
Monica	As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Monica	Men are such idiots.
Monica	Yeah, let-let-lets pretend thats not true.
Monica	What-whats going on?
Monica	When, when didhow, how did you
Monica	(to Ross) I cant believe youre getting married!
Joey	Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at him.)
Chandler	Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey, and Phoebe.)
Monica	Chandler, thats like your fourth cup of coffee!
Monica	Hes in a different room! Hes really that loud?
Monica	Yknow I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over
Monica	He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Monica	Have you guys picked a date yet?
Monica	Ugh, shes upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! Im not doing them this time! I dont care if those dishes sit in the sink until theyre all covered withIll do them when I get home!
Monica	Ill pick it up for you!
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! Its so beautiful!
Monica	Oh, yes, umm, Im here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Monica	Emily Waltham.
The Saleslady	Yes! I have it right here. (Phoebe and Monica both gasp at the dress.) Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
Monica	(laughs) Okay.
Monica	I am, arent I?
Monica	Yes?
Monica	All right. (Goes to take off the dress.)
Monica	Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.)
Monica	Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. (Theres a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!
Monica	Phoebe?
Monica	Can you just hold on for one minute?
Monica	Are you alone?
Monica	All right.
Monica	Okay, ready?
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Congratulations!
Monica	Okay! My turn! My turn!
Monica	(cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual) Yeah.
Monica	(upset) That was a terrible throw!!
Monica	Look at me! My big concern is whats real?! (Finally realises) Oh my God. Were really sad, arent we?
Monica	This isnt even my dress.
Monica	Im changing out of this.
Monica	In like a half-hour?
Monica	Okay, throw it straight this time.
Monica	Im getting married next!!
Monica	Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didnt you start feeling silly?
Monica	Oh God.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Monica	No, seriously.
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? Cause I dont think you have to wear it unless you are!
Monica	Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.
Monica	Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
Monica	Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emilys wedding dress into Rachels room.)
Phoebe	(looks at Monica) Hey, yknow what might cheer you up?
Monica	Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause) Maybe someday, there will be.
Monica	Oh God! Hes gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Monica	No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!
Monica	Rachel?!
Rachel	Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Monica	Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (To Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Ross	You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Monica, Joey, and Phoebe	[singing] I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Rachel	Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monicas photo albums, I mean you dont do that if youre just in it for two weeks.
Monica	Ohh, this is soo amazing! I cant believe my brothers getting married! And in London! Its so romantic!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	I never knew that either.
Monica	Were hanging out.
Monica	Im sorry honey.
Monica	Rach, youre gonna come though arent you?
Monica	You know what would be real weird? Is if you werent there. Just say youll think about it, okay?
Monica	I can't believe he did this.
Monica	You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Mrs. Geller	Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Mr. Geller	Wait, how do you zoom out? (zooms out and we see an extremely overweight Monica eating a big sandwich) There she is.
Monica	Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Monica	Oh, dad, turn it off.
Monica	If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Rachel, Monica, Roy, and Chip	Bye.
Monica	(seeing the decision) Nooooo. Youre really not going?
Monica	You dont have a car. And your license expired.
Monica	Thats also like the tenth time you told us.
Monica	What?
Monica	I thought that was a good thing.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Yeah, theres one right under the cabinet.
Monica	Why do you need it?
Monica	What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come youre having a party and were not invited?
Monica	Sooo?
Monica	Nooo!
Monica	The baby shower for Phoebe!
Monica	Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?
Monica	Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (Its a little pink and white dress for the girl baby.)
Monica	I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Monica	Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
Monica	Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Monica	Oh, shes gonna love that!
Rachel	Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebes way.)
Monica	Hi Phoebe.
Monica	Hormones.
Monica	Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. Thats great. So how-how are things going?
Monica	Heres your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a step back.)
Phoebe	(sips it) Its so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of relief.) Oh, thanks.
Monica	Im so glad you liked it.
Monica	What?!
Rachel	What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	Wait, you cant have the baby here! I mean I havent sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Monica	Rachel, get the book! The book!
Rachel	Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!
Monica	The Bible?!
Monica	How do you feel?
Monica	Some moms do that.
Monica	Aww, sweetie, but its not like youre not gonna have anything. Youre gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways thats even better.
Monica	I mean, youre the one theyre gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)
Chandler	Six-hour trip to London. Thats a lot of Monica.
Monica	Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera, check! Travellers cheques, check!
Monica	Myself. Yknow for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Yep! You got the tickets?
Monica	Okay, if you need the vacuum, its in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator
Monica	Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Monica	All right, yknow what? We really are late! Lets go! Lets go! Lets go!!
Monica	Chicken Kiev?
Monica	Yeah, yknow, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldnt have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.) So, I cant wait to see this place youre getting married!
Monica	Its nice.
Monica	(entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
Monica	They torn it down a few days early.
Phoebe	Well, because we thought you knew!! Its so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean."
Emily	No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Ross	Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isnt right.
Monica	(entering) Hey!
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	(laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Monica	Umm
Monica	She said that?!
Monica	Why?!
Monica	Oh my God. Youre even dumber than I am!
Monica	Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Monica	Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. Thats what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Monica	Sometimes we were.
Monica	Okay.
Emily	Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
Monica	Youll see.
Monica	And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and (Points to Ross) You go.
Monica	Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	I know. How could we have let this happen?
Monica	Ugh! Well, yknow, we were away
Monica	I blame London.
Monica	So look umm, while were st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Monica	Only here.
Monica	Ill meet you there in two minutes.
Monica	(impatiently) Now?
Monica	Oh, I-I dont know.
Rachel	Monica, what should I do?
Monica	Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)
Monica	Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave, but is stopped by Rachel.)
Monica	Wait. Rachel, no, hes married. Married! If you dont realize that, I cant help you.
Monica	Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Monica	Why?!
Monica	Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldnt eat meat until she has the babies!
Monica	Thats true.
Monica	Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Monica	Yes, I want to change. And why-why dont you go down and get us a table?
Monica	(elbows him) Fifteen minutes.
Monica	Great
Chandler	(To Monica) Hey, listen, why dont we go change in my room?
Monica	But my clothes areohh! (They both leave.)
Monica	No time for that!
Joey	No you dont, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Monica	Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. Its My Giant!
Monica	You really think this is okay?
Monica	Oh, its so beautiful. Ohh! Yknow, I-I dont know if I feel right about this.
Monica	Okay!
Monica	You didnt find her?
Monica	Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Monica	Or 45.
Chandler	Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)
Monica	Well, its getting late.
Monica	Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Monica	I know, Ive been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, dont you think?
Monica	Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again.
Monica	Im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe Ill see you there in a bit?
Joey	Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Monica	I know!
Phoebe	(To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You had sex! (Theyre shocked.)
Phoebe	I know you didnt, I was talking about Monica.
Monica	Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Monica	Well, we certainly are alone.
Monica	Right. Umm, listen since were-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Rosss mother
Monica	Well, an-anyway, I justthat night meant a lot to me, I guess Im just trying to say thanks.
Monica	(laughs) Thats okay.
Monica	And youre cute too.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	That counts!
Monica	You look cute in bubbles.
Monica	Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
pain as Monica grabs him underwater)-Diet Coke	pain as Monica grabs him underwater)-Diet Coke.
Joey	(interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)
Monica	Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Monica	Bodington's!
Monica	Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch) she should be here by now.
Monica	No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Monica	Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Monica	I'll do it!
Rachel	That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Monica	Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Rachel	Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can'tI still can't believe it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)
Monica	Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Monica	Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)
Monica	Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Monica	Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
Monica	If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Monica	(Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Monica	You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Monica	We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Phoebe	(Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't watch.)
Monica	What happened?
Monica	See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Monica	What took you so long?
Monica	Oh, good.
Monica	Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Rachel	Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Ross	Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Monica	(Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Monica	What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Monica	I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Monica	(Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Monica	I make the decisions, and I say no.
Monica	You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Rachel	Well (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)
Monica	Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Monica	Rachel locked the door.
Monica	Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Monica	Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Monica	I really need to talk to you.
Monica	Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Monica	Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.
Ross	Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My God, think of the massacre.
Monica	All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Monica	Please!
Monica	Joey, I'm in!
Monica	Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central Park!
Monica	Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)
Monica	Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Monica	Come on Rach, let's go.
Monica	No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Monica	Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Monica	Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)
Monica	Oh my God! You're water broke!
Monica	I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Monica	Do you know anything about women?
Monica	That's all right.
Monica	Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Monica	Oh man! I did it again!
Monica	What?
Monica	That's what it sounded like.
Rachel	(entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Monica	Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Monica	Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Monica	Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Ross	Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Monica	Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Monica	Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Monica	Feeling a little better sweetie?
Monica	Me too.
Joey	(interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an optionwhat's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are you crazy?!
Monica	(entering with Chandler) Hey!
Monica	(To Phoebe) How are you doing?
Rachel	Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. (Mouths "He's yours." to her.) Uh Dan, Monica.
Monica	Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Monica	Chandler!
Monica	So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Monica	Oh, great!
Monica	Bye Dan!
Dan	Uh, bye Monica.
Monica	Great!
Monica	Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Monica	I think you're better than you think you are.
Monica	(interrupting) Know when to stop.
Monica	Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't do the dance.
Monica	I think you're my favorite.
Monica	I don't care.
Monica	Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Monica	(In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Rachel	Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out in horror.) Oh my God!
Monica	(pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Rachel	Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Monica	Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Monica	Uh-huh, that one!
Monica	(Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm (Rachel opens the door.) It's just Joey and Ross.
Joey	(to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!
Monica	But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Chandler	(entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Monica	Vomit tux? Who vomited ony'know what, what you up to Joe?
Monica	Oh that's great!
Monica	What's wrong with PBS?
Rachel	So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Monica	Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Chandler	Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?
Monica	I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?
Chandler	Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you lucky dog!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	That's great!
Monica	What?!
Monica	But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.
Monica	Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Chandler	(entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Monica	Sure!
Monica	Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Monica	Great!
Monica	What?! You can'twhat did you tell her?
Monica	Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Monica	No, you cannot.
Monica	(answering it) Hello.
Monica	Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Monica	(Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.
Monica	(entering) Hi Chandler.
Monica	Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Monica	William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Monica	Yeah, so?
Monica	Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Monica	Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy dance.)
Monica	A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Monica	All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Monica	Keep talking.
Monica	Really?
Monica	Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) Oh my When is Joey gonna be home?
Monica	But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Monica	Yeah. (She takes them off.)
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Ow!
Monica	I know!
Monica	Never done that before.
Monica	(quietly) Hi!
Joey	Monica? What time is it?
Monica	Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Monica	I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Monica	All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Monica	Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Monica	Wait! What about Joey?
Monica	(entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Monica	Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	No, she's out shopping.
Monica	Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Chandler	We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Chandler	Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)
Monica	Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Monica	Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles
Rachel	Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Oh my God.
Monica	Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Monica	Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Monica	Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back.
Chandler	Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Monica	We're switching rooms.
Monica	No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Monica	We're switching rooms again.
Monica	This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Monica	(To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Monica	Chandler!
Monica	Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Monica	Okay, this one I like!
Monica	Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Monica	Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Monica	I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Monica	We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Monica	What did you say?
Monica	(entering) Hi!
Monica	Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Monica	Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Monica	Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)
Chandler	Monica. (Follows her out.)
Monica	Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Monica	300 dollars?!
Monica	Urghh!!
Monica	Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Monica	Maybe I could do it.
Monica	Hey.
Rachel	See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Monica	You're not gonna be phased out!
Ross	I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Monica	Hi.
Monica	Yeah, it did.
Monica	What?
Monica	Why, exactly?
Monica	Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh! (They both realize something there.)
Monica	(laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Monica	Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)
Monica	I'm afraid so.
Monica	Hey!
Phoebe	Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Monica	Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Monica	Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Chandler	Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)
Joey	(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
Monica	Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Monica	Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Monica	I know, it's great!
Monica	Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Monica	Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Monica	Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Monica	Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)
Monica	What?!
Monica	Sorry.
Monica	(To Chandler) Rachel's at work.
Monica	Hey, what's that?
Monica	What is that?
Monica	(looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.
Monica	So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Monica	Now calm down Joey.
Monica	Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Rachel	Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Monica	Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Monica	All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Monica	Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Monica	We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Monica	And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Monica	Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Monica	We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Wow! That guy is so rude!
Monica	Well you did a little bit.
Monica	I totally forgive you!
Monica	Yes!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Monica	Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Monica	No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Monica	God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Phoebe	Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Monica	Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Monica	Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Monica	Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Monica	How did that happen?
Monica	I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Monica	Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Monica	I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)
Monica	How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
Monica	Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Monica	Oh, Larry.
Monica	Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
Monica	Larry?
Monica	Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Monica	It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Monica	Thanks.
Rachel	Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?
Monica	Hmm?
Monica	He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try
Monica	Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Monica	(To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Monica	Ohh, fun!
Monica	Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Monica	And you're not gonna do that.
Monica	So-so there is no party.
Monica	I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Monica	Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Monica	You are?
Danny	Okay, (To Monica) hope I see you tomorrow night.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Monica	Great. So the ball is in his court?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	I don't know, clean places?
Monica	(looking through the peephole) It's Danny.
Monica	(to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it starts later?
Monica	The fake kind!
Monica	We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)
Monica	Okay, great!
Monica	Just go over and say hi.
Monica	Hey, Danny!
Monica	(turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm, what's this? (Points to his plate.)
Monica	Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and what-what's this? (Points again.)
Monica	(upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.
Rachel	Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Monica	I thought there wasn't a ball?
Monica	I think I need a drink.
Rachel	Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Phoebe	Monica your remote doesn't work.
Monica	Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Monica	That's very nice.
Monica	Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Rachel	I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Monica	Oh, let's not tell this story.
Phoebe	Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Phoebe	Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Monica	(entering) Hey!
Monica	Hey, did you get the turkey bastedOh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
Monica	What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Monica	Well, get it off now!
Monica	Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Monica	Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!
Monica	Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Monica	That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Monica	Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Chandler	Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Monica	Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Mrs. Geller	Monica! I think Rachel's here!
Monica	I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!
Fat Monica	Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Fat Monica	Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Big Nosed Rachel	Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! (Walks into the living room and greets Monica's parents.) Hi!
Fat Monica	Ross! (Wanting to be introduced.)
Ross	Oh, this is Monica.
Fat Monica	Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Fat Monica	Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Fat Monica	dammit! (Runs off.)
Fat Monica	I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Fat Monica	Call them mom and dad you loser!
Ross	(in a high pitched voice) Monica!
Fat Monica	Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Fat Monica	Okay!
Fat Monica	Oh that's so great!
Fat Monica	Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Fat Monica	I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Mrs. Geller	(holding two pies) Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
Fat Monica	No. No, thank you!
Monica	Well, I do.
Monica	Yes, it was!
Monica	(interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Chandler	We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Ross	So uh, where's Monica?
Mrs. Geller	She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Monica	Hi, Chandler.
Monica	What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She turns around making sure he gets a good look.)
Mrs. Geller	Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Monica	So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Monica	Well it didn't!
Monica	Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Monica	How?
Monica	What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Monica	Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Monica	What do you mean?
Monica	(excited) I can do that!
Chandler	Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Monica	Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Monica	Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)
Monica	Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that(She drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)
Monica	Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her purse and hands it to the doctor.)
Monica	What?! What is it?
Monica	God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Monica	Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Monica	I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Monica	I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Monica	Chandler! (Follows him out.)
Monica	Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Monica	Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Monica	Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
Chandler	Look, Monica
Monica	Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
Monica	I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
Monica	What?
Monica	You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Monica	Yes, you did!
Monica	You love me!
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	(entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Joey	Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)
Monica	(inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Monica	We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Monica	We are! Help us!
Joey	All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.
Monica	Joey!
Monica	Hey, Phoebe!
Monica	Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)
Monica	Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Monica	Phoebe?
Monica	Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Monica	We're so sorry.
Monica	Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Monica	Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)
Monica	I know.
Ross	(in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!
Monica	Ross, are you okay?
Monica	Why?!
Monica	A pill?
Monica	Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Monica	(yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!
The Teacher	Monica, you asked the question.
Rachel	(sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Chandler	(Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
Rachel	Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Monica	(grabbing the picture) Give me that!
Monica	It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Monica	Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Joey	(thinking) I slept with Monica.
Monica	Oh no!
Rachel	Monica, is this true?
Monica	Yes it's true.
Joey	Ahhoy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Monica	I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir.
Ross	My God Monica!!
Joey	No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Joey	Uhh, Monica?
Monica	I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Monica	I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
A Female Student	Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
Monica	(entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Monica	Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) We should have essay questions!!
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)
Monica	Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her change purse into the bucket.)
Monica	Hey, what's up?
Monica	Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Monica	You had no relationship!!
Monica	Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Monica	Come on, hurry!
Rachel	So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Phoebe	Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Monica	No.
Monica	No.
Monica	Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)
Monica	Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Monica	Still, I was quick as a cat.
Monica	Oh, you're kidding.
Monica	(laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Monica	Too strong for me?
Monica	You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Monica	Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start wrestling.)
Monica	That was unbelievable!
Monica	Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Monica	It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Monica	This is disgusting!
Chandler	(deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.
Monica	Oh no, wait! Joey!
Chandler	(To Monica) Happy New Year!
Monica	Happy New Year.
Monica	She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Monica	Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Monica	Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Monica	Hi Ben!
Ben	Auntie Monica!! (He runs to hug her.)
Monica	I like 'em.
Monica	I like them a lot.
Rachel	Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and Monica.)
Monica	It's my New Year's resolution!
Monica	No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Joey	Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)
Joey	No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)
Monica	Thank you. (Leaves.)
Monica	(on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Monica	(on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
Monica	We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Monica	Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Monica	See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Ross	Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)
Monica	Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Rachel	Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Joey	Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Joey	Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Monica	Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Monica	I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
Monica	Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)
Doug	Hey Bing! (Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica) Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
Chandler	I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Monica	Hi, nice to meet you!
Kara	Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! (Slaps Chandler on his butt.)
Doug	Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight. (They walk off leaving Chandler and Monica alone.)
Monica	What was that?
Monica	That noise you just made?
Monica	Really? Your work laugh?
Monica	All right, check me out.
Monica	Really?
Monica	Hey, I thought you already had one.
Rachel	(To Monica) Hey!
Monica	Hi!
Monica	What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Rachel	Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Monica	Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Monica	Okay. Umm
Monica	Okay, what's going on with you?
Monica	Well, I-Ithere was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Monica	Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Monica	Game!
Monica	Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Monica	I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Monica	Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
Monica	They have racquets don't they?!
Chandler	Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? (Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!
Monica	I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Monica	I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and Kara and scores a point.)
Monica	I got it!!
Chandler	Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
Monica	I can't believe you let them win!
Monica	I was frustrated.
Monica	I was frustrated with you!
Monica	Y'know what really bothers me? Isit's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" (Mocks the fake laugh.) I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Monica	I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Monica	Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.) Where the hell have you been?!!
Monica	My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Rachel	Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Monica	What?!
Monica	Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Monica	Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big(Thinks)ot.
Monica	Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Monica	Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)
Monica	Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Doug	Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh? (Once again, with the laugh.)
Monica	(To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Monica	Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Monica	I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Monica	(interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Monica	Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Chandler	I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.
Monica	I thought you could use the help.
Joey	Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Monica	Sorry! I'm justI'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
Monica	I know! It's just thatever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Monica	(entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Monica	Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.
Monica	Okay great!
Monica	Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Monica	Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	I'll get back to my new job.
Rachel	'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and is almost in tears.)
Monica	I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Monica	That was a half an hour?
Monica	Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
Monica	It's so good, isn't it?
Monica	Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Monica	(entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Monica	Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Monica	(to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Monica	What?! What honey?
Monica	Oh, did you catch him?!
Monica	All right, let's go say good-bye.
Monica	Well, at least you scared someone.
Monica	Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Monica	What are you talking about?
Monica	(indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She starts giving Chandler a massage.)
Monica	No he's not!
Monica	What?!
Monica	You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Monica	But the minute we start to lie to each other (Pauses after she realizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society.
Monica	No.
Monica	Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell mejust say, "I don't like your massages."
Monica	(starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.
Monica	I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
Monica	(bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Monica	Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Monica	I'm crying here!!
Monica	Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Chandler	Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Monica	So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Monica	Okay. I suck!
Monica	Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Phoebe	(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Phoebe	(screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Phoebe	You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Rachel	Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Monica	You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Monica	Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Monica	What?
Monica	What are you talking about?
Monica	That's not possible!
Monica	I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Monica	I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Monica	This bicep?
Monica	Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Monica	Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Monica	Okay.
Monica	I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Monica	Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Monica	Well what did you send?
Monica	Bye!
Monica	Actually, I did!
Monica	Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Monica	Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Monica	Them?! Who's them?
Monica	Joey!
Monica	Unless
Monica	Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So
Chandler	Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
Monica	(in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!
Monica	Oh yeah!
Rachel	Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's shoulder.)
Monica	All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Monica	Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Monica	Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Monica	Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)
Monica	She's bluffing!
Monica	You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Monica	Of course.
Chandler	Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Chandler	Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Monica	I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
Monica	Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Ross	Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Chandler	(To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)
Monica	What are you doing?!
Monica	Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Chandler	Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Monica	I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Monica	Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Monica	But what?
Monica	In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Monica	I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Chandler	Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Rachel	Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Rachel	Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Chandler	I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! Im right. I'm right. Am I right?
Monica	Isn't this great?
Monica	Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.) Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Monica	Are you okay?
Monica	What-what are you doing?
Monica	Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
Monica	Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Monica	Oh and you know what I want!
Monica	I do not have baby fever!
Monica	Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Monica	You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)
Monica	Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?
Chandler	Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
Monica	I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Monica	What?!
Monica	Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)
Chandler	Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Monica	(raising her hand) I'm Monica.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Chandler	(getting out a ring box) Monica
Monica	No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Monica	Chandler, why are you doing this?
Monica	Chandler.
Monica	Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Monica	(kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Monica	Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Monica	Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Monica	Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Monica	Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Monica	Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Monica	Hey!
Chandler	Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?
Monica	(checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)
Monica	I know.
Monica	Wow!
Monica	Hey.
Joey	(To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Monica	Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Monica	I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Joey	No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Monica	Are you saying I smell bad?
Monica	What's with him?
Monica	(cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
Joey	(To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.
Monica	Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)
Monica	What is going on with you?
Joey	Well, it involved Monica.
Chandler	You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! (To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)
Monica	What was the dream about?
Joey	Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Monica	Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesnt mean that-that you're in love with me!
Monica	No!
Monica	Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Monica	Um-hmm.
Chandler	Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Monica	Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly realizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Chandler	Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Monica	You become friends after?
Monica	(laughing) That's right.
Joey	Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Joey	Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great
Ross	Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Chandler	Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so
Monica	Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Monica	What about the closeness?
Monica	Who is it?
Monica	Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)
Monica	Did I squeeze it too hard?
Joey	That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before.
Monica	Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Joey	(waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.) (Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Monica	Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Joey	Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.) Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor
Monica	(joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Joey	Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica away and makes a disgusted face.)
Monica	What happened?
Monica	No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
Monica	What?
Monica	Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Monica	I know it is the best.
Monica	What? It's still going on.
Monica	I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Monica	(Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why dont you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Phoebe	(Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was wrong obviously, I justI misspoke. It's okay.
Monica	Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Chandler	(entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Monica	You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)
Monica	(entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
Monica	Yes!
Monica	A kiss? What are you talking about?
Monica	He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Chandler	I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)
Monica	Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	(That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
Monica	Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Monica	Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Monica	Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Monica	'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Monica	So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Chandler	Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Monica	Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Monica	We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Monica	No, you're the best.
Monica	I am the best.
Monica	(looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Monica	Why?
Monica	What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Monica	No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Joey	I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Monica	You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Monica	Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Monica	You didn't!
Monica	The park huh? A public place.
Monica	I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)
Monica	Hi Chandler.
Chandler	Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?
Monica	Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Chandler	No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Monica	Come on, we can't let them win!
Monica	Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Monica	I feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore.
Monica	Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Monica	Really?
Monica	That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Monica	Yeah. (They hug.)
Monica	Did not.
Monica	Okay, I freaked out a little.
Chandler	Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.
Monica	Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Monica	Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Monica	I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Monica	I would love to do it together!
Monica	It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Chandler	Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in agreement.)
Monica	That doesn't seem fair.
Monica	Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)
Monica	All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Monica	Oh, we're not doing that. Okay
Monica	What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Monica	(Thinks) Cups.
Monica	And ice!
Monica	Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant
Monica	Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Monica	Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) "Audition didn't go so well. (Happily) Yeah it did?"
Monica	You got a callback too didn't you?
Phoebe	Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Monica	(To Rachel) How did work go?
Monica	You stink!
Monica	No, I'm-I'm serious!
Monica	That's so gross!
Monica	Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)
Monica	(overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!
Monica	Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Chandler	There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!
Monica	Y'knowgo! Go! Right there! (Points)
Monica	That's the surprise!
Chandler	Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Monica	(entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Monica	So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London
Monica	Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Monica	That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Monica	That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Monica	(runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!
Monica	You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Monica	Great!
Phoebe	Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Rachel	Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Monica	(noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?
Monica	It's a diaper commercial.
Monica	What's goin' on?
Chandler	Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
Monica	It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Monica	It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Monica	Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Monica	Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Monica	What?
Monica	(following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Monica	No you didn't.
Chandler	So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Monica	Yeah, it's good.
Monica	Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Monica	Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Monica	No way!
Monica	Well that's pathetic!
Monica	And this goes for all guys?
Monica	No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Monica	(entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.)
Phoebe	All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Monica	Yeah, what is it?
Monica	(shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
Monica	All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Monica	Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?
Monica	(angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Monica	Yes!
Phoebe	Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)
Ross	(He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)
Chandler	(To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
Monica	What about these? These look the same?
Monica	Not as each other!
Chandler	(To Monica) Hey!
Monica	Hi!
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Monica	Oh, honey, the earrings
Monica	My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Monica	Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Monica	Hey!
Phoebe	Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Monica	Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Monica	Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)
Monica	You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Monica	All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Monica	I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Monica	All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Monica	Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around
Monica	What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Joey	Are you thinking about Monica?
Monica	(on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Monica	I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
Monica	See if he has ice.
Monica	(does Rachel's) Nooo!
Rachel	(does Monica's) I know!
Monica	Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Monica	We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Monica	I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesnt that give me the right to control himhelp him?
Monica	No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Monica	Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Monica	All right, I guess we should go.
Monica	Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)
Rachel	No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Monica	There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Monica	Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Monica	Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Ross	(looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Monica	Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Chandler	(To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Monica	No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Monica	So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Monica	(shocked) Oh my God!
Monica	I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Monica	I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral
Monica	(sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Monica	He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
Monica	Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Monica	Ohhhh!
Monica	That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)
Chandler	(To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)
Rachel	Is Monica here?
Chandler	Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Monica	(entering) Hey guys!
Monica	Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter) It was right here, where is it?
Monica	All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Monica	Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Monica	What?!
Ross	Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Monica	Really?!
Monica	(on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up and keeps throwing the ball.)
Monica	Rach?
Monica	You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are covered with scratches.)
Monica	(shocked) What?!
Monica	I don't want a cat!
Monica	(To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Ross	(catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Monica	(jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Monica	He's a dropper!
Chandler	Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)
Monica	Oh myOh good God!
Monica	So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Monica	Rach, why won't they take it back?
Monica	Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Monica	Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Monica	So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Monica	Why, do you write him a lot?
Monica	Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Monica	Please! I made this game what it is.
Monica	All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
Monica	All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.
Monica	Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
Monica	Wow! You made a profit!
Monica	All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Monica	It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Monica	Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)
Monica	(To Rachel) Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Monica	Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Monica	It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Monica	Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? (And on the "I" part she mimics poking her eye.)
Rachel	(flinches again) Monica! Come on!
Monica	Bye!
Monica	Why are so mad at him?
Monica	Well, it just seems that
Chandler	All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?
Monica	Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.
Monica	Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Monica	No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)
Phoebe	Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Joey	Monica. Oh huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
Joey	Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Monica	(looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Monica	I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Monica	A small puff of air, now come on!
Monica	Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Monica	Okay. (Monica backs off.)
Monica	Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F D.
Dr. Miller	Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Monica	I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.) (To Rachel) And you don't get one!
Monica	They're still in my coat.
Monica	I love you.
"{There's another continuity error here. Before Monica says I love you, Chandler's
on this!"	{There's another continuity error here. Before Monica says I love you, Chandler's holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely. After she says the line and the camera cuts back to Chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded sloppily, unlike before. Hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!}
Monica	I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Monica	Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Monica	Chandler! What are you doing here?
Monica	Not even close.
Monica	Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Monica	Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)
Monica	Put your head back.
Monica	All right.
Monica	Now, open your eyes.
Monica	How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)
Monica	Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Monica	Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Monica	No drops!
Monica	Okay.
Monica	On three, 123! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the eyedropper.)
Monica	Then why did you move?!
Monica	All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by her legs.)
Rachel	(as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)
Monica	I am going I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm I am going to get these drops in your eyes. (She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.)
Rachel	Monica! Stop it!
Monica	(spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!
Rachel	Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqu pose, at least for primetime TV.)
Monica	(answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's proud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Monica	What did you do to his sweater vests?
Joey	Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Monica	Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)
Monica	Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Monica	(answering it) Hello?
Joey	(on phone from Vegas) Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Monica	Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Monica	Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Joey	Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Monica	Go!!
Monica	Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone climbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Phoebe	Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica? (Goes into Monica's bedroom.)
Monica	(entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Monica	Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Monica	The Richard.
Monica	Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Monica	It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Monica	Really?
Monica	The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Monica	Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Monica	I know.
Monica	What?
Monica	It's almost our anniversary!
Monica	I got you a present!
Monica	I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)
Monica	(grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Monica	For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Monica	No.
Monica	Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Monica	But we can go, right?
Monica	Okay!
Chandler	Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.
Monica	Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Chandler	(To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.
Monica	Aww! I love you!
Monica	Okay!
Monica	I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Monica	Oh that's okay. Dont worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Phoebe	(To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Monica	Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Monica	Really?!
Monica	Great!
Monica	Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
Monica	Who are you talking too?
Monica	I'm so sorry.
Monica	I knew you were not okay with that.
Phoebe	Monica had lunch with Richard.
Monica	It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
Monica	You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Monica	I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Monica	I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Monica	Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Monica	Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Monica	No it is not!
Monica	(to the bartender) Thank you.
Monica	I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Phoebe	Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so sorry.
Monica	This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Monica	Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to find Chandler.)
Phoebe	Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Monica	Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes her head no.)
The Croupier	Comin' out. Place your bet. (Monica does so.) Dice are out. (The woman next to Monica rolls the dice.) Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! (Monica won and doubled the chip.)
Monica	Hmm.
Phoebe	Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Monica	All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Monica	Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Monica	What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! Im sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Monica	Not any more.
Monica	Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is empty.
Chandler	(arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!
Monica	Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Monica	We have one.
Monica	(shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the dice.) Yes!
Monica	That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Monica	Pick a number! That is your only job!
Monica	Thank you!
Monica	Yes!
Monica	(To Chandler) We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Monica	Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
Monica	What?
Monica	Okay. (Rolls the dice)
Chandler	Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.
Monica	All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! (Rolls the dice.)
Monica	Oh, that's because I had lunch with RichMe neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Monica	Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Monica	Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Monica	What did you just say?
Monica	Are you serious?!
Monica	I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Monica	Okay!
Monica	Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Monica	That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
Monica	I think so too.
Monica	Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Monica	You're so efficient. I love you!
Monica	No-no-no! We need something old!
Monica	That'll work!
Monica	Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Monica	That's stealing!
Monica	Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
Monica	Yep, we wanna get married!
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	No, only because that's the graduation song.
Monica	Are you sure you wanna do this?
Monica	Whoa!
Phoebe	(to her) Hey! Dont you give me any of yourHey! (Sees Chandler and Monica standing there.)
Monica	What are you guys doing here?
Monica	Why else would we be here?
Monica	This is insane!
Monica	What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	Hey.
Chandler	Monica and I almost got married last night.
Chandler	Look, I just dont think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Yknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Yknow? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Monica	How do I tell Chandler that its too soon. Its gonna break his heart, hes not gonna think that I dont love him anymore.
Monica	Yes I do!
Monica	Oh hi! Hi! Yknow, we were just talking about bacon.
Monica	Rach! We werent gonna miss our friends getting married!
Monica	What are you guys gonna do?
Monica	So, what do you think we should do?
Monica	I know I love you! (They hug.)
Monica	Thats a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Monica	All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we dont get married.
Monica	Okay. (They approach the craps table.)
Monica	Ready?
Monica	(sarcastic) Come on eight.
Monica	Wow! I cant believe I actually rolled an eight.
Monica	Wait a minute. That wasnt a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Monica	I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?
Monica	Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler and Monica standing side-by-side holding each others hands.)
Monica	That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Monica	He took my snack!
Monica	Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad.
Chandler	Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
Monica	This doesnt mean anything, does it?
Monica	Okay.
Monica	No, dont say it! Dont even think it!
Monica	Im sick of the signs! Its too fast, Im happy the way things are!
Monica	I dont want things to change! Do you?
Monica	All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because its been three days and its driving me insane!
Monica	Then all your stuff would be here.
Monica	Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnt make any sense.
Monica	Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Monica	YES!!!!!!!!
Monica	Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Monica	Heres your key (Gets him one.)
Monica	Heres your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
Monica	Ready!
Monica	Wait! Oh my God! I cant get out!
Monica	No, its not a sign! Its a very old key!
Monica	Oh my God its old!
Monica	I love you!
Monica	No.
Monica	Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?
Monica	Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?
Monica	Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with! Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them. Okay? Thats it.
Monica	Pretty much.
Joey	(entering) Hey Monica!
Monica	Hi!
Monica	Joey, we have something to tell you.
Chandler	No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, heres the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, Im gonna be moving out man.
Joey	Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh Hey! Im really happy for you guys! Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the verge of tears as Monica stops him.)
Monica	Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Chandler	Look, I-Im just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up Im moving right back in with you!
Joey	(To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if youre gonna be moving in with him I feel its my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? Hes a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm Oh-oh he always, he always ummOh, who am I kidding! Hes the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)
Monica	Hey Pheebs!
Monica	Hey, have you seen Rachel?
Monica	I have some pretty exciting news!
Monica	No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Monica	Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)
Monica	Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesnt seem so bad? (Exits.)
Monica	Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Monica	I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and shes the only one left!
Monica	No.
Chandler	(To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
Monica	Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Monica	Really?!
Monica	Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct her.)
Monica	Yeah, hes gonna work on that.
Monica	(singing) Well be waiting for you
Monica	Soon! I-I just couldnt before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldnt do that to her, shes my best friend!
Monica	Im not your best friend?
Monica	All right, all right, at least Im prepared.
Monica	(slapping his hand) Hey!
Monica	These arent for you! Are you upset?
Monica	Rach, theres something uh, important I have to tell you.
Monica	No! But, Im throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Monica	Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Monica	Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasnt clear! Im really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? Theres absolutely no rush.
Monica	Okay. Dont you want a cookie?
Rachel	Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.
Monica	Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Rachel	Monica, where did you get these?!
Monica	I made them!
Monica	(entering) Hi.
Monica	So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Monica	Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. She wasnt angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)
Monica	I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Dont I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Monica	Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Monica	Yknow, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Monica	Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I dont know if I want it because it might be yknow, too many memories!
Monica	I dont know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Monica	Something to remember me by!
Monica	But still, its a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Monica	Im fine! I just, Im thinking how much its an end of era.
Monica	An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasnt significant to you!
Monica	What is the matter with you?!! Why arent you more upset?! Arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean arent you gonna miss me at all?!
Monica	Whats hard to believe?
Monica	Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
Monica	No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Monica	Yeah, sweetie.
Monica	No.
Monica	Im gonna miss you! (They hug.)
Monica	I know!
Rachel	Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Joey	So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Phoebe	Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it wont work out.
Monica	Whos Denise?
Monica	Okay listen, yknow when you move in Rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Monica	Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.
Monica	No.
Monica	Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Monica	I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Monica	What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Monica	Are you mocking me?
Chandler	Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Rachel	Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses him on the cheek and exits.)
Monica	Hi.
Chandler	Hi, listen, Im sorry about before. I dont need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnt get girls, and now I can emNow, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women
Monica	Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) Im sorry too.
Monica	Yeah! Oh yes!
Monica	Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Monica	Totally!
Monica	Oh good.
Monica	Changes?
Monica	Youre-youre-youre gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Monica	Well, its a set and they should probably stay together.
Monica	See now-now youre taking them away from their home.
Monica	Yeah-yeah, yknow what? Yeah, thats it-thats it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! Thats-thats what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! Im talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesnt match! Where is it gonna go?!
Monica	Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Rachel	Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
Monica	Ross, we can handle this.
Chandler	Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks him and he joins in.)
Monica	Love is the best medicine.
Monica	Why do you do it?
Ross	Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Monica	Yes.
Ross	Youre never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. Thats great news rightI mean for them. Right?
Monica	Thats very funny!
Monica	Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Monica	Yeah, no, me neither.
Ross	Fine! Its your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.) I just dont want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but thats what you want, theres nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DONT DO IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)
Monica	You still want to move in together right?
Monica	Ross didnt scare you?
Monica	Come here, I want to show you something!
Monica	This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and its still walking distance to the kitchen.
Monica	Okay!
Monica	Uh-hmm.
Monica	Oh my God! I love that!
Monica	Uh, no!!
Rachel	Umm, well lets see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Monica	This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.)
Monica	And its a magnet!
Monica	Hey Rach, arent these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?
Monica	Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Monica	(under her breath) That youre a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a drawer.)
Monica	Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Phoebe thats crazy!
Rachel	Monica!
Monica	Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)
Monica	No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Monica	I loved them!
Rachel	Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Howd the lecture go?
Monica	That youre not funny or sexy?
Monica	Yeah, but yknow we could sneak in and watch.
Rachel	Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! Theres some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.
Ross	(to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.
Monica	What the hell are you doing?!
Monica	(in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her R)
Ross	(in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?
Monica	(normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I cant?! (To an exiting student in accent.) Top O the morning to ya laddies!
Monica	Gimme em!
Monica	You stole them from me!
Monica	Gimme them!
Monica	You just wanna each take one?
Monica	Why dont you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in America.
Ross	Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Monica	I think you look fine.
Monica	Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Monica	Yes!
Joey	Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, dont hold back. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Monica	Youre kidding!
Monica	Ross!
Monica	Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?
Monica	Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Monica	Dont worry about it Phoebe, well absolutely do it.
Monica	Come on Chandler, come on! Itll give us great practice for when(realizes what shes about to say and changes)people with babies come to visit.
Monica	Pheebs, hows it going?
Monica	Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Monica	What do you mean?
Monica	This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Joey	The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyre gonna start to think that I dont own it. So I figured Ill wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Monica	Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
Monica	I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Monica	And six others.
Monica	Yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.
Monica	Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someones eye out!
Chandler	Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)
Monica	Oh its so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Monica	How are you still single?!
Monica	Good. What made you change your mind?
Monica	Damnit! Yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)
Monica	And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes?
Monica	Joey, you know you dont actually have one.
Monica	All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.
Monica	The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!
Monica	Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital.
Phoebe	Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.) Okay, Im sorry. I didnt mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? Cause lets face it, were at Monicas. (She crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All right. Well, thats just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the vase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you cant answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV cabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh, youre a lot mischievous! Well, itll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay, you sit with your brother and sister nowwho arent there! (They both have disappeared as well.)
Monica	Oh my God.
Monica	Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
Monica	But my apartment!
Monica	But the mess!
Monica	Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out. Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Monica	(entering from her room) Hey!
Monica	(thinks) Okay.
Monica	Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought wed go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Monica	Its not your birthday.
Monica	Youre not dressed yet?! Were supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Monica	Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that youre packed.
Rachel	Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Phoebe	Oh my God! Monicas just gonna kill you.
Monica	(entering) Rachel, I need to borrowYoure not packed!!!! Youre not packed even a little bit!
Monica	What?
Monica	(grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) Ill be coordinator! Oh my God! Im so sorry, I didnt get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, cant you Phoebe?
Monica	Youre plans were with us.
Monica	All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Monica	Okay! (To Rachel) Oh my God, thank you!!
Phoebe	Hurry! Monicas gonna make you pack! Shes got jobs for everyone! Now, its too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the door.)
Monica	(entering and interrupting the guys escape attempt) Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, were gonna start with
Monica	I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Monica	Okay fine, now Ross
Monica	Why not?
Monica	Its almost 8 oclock, its almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Monica	Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Monica	All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachels room.)
Monica	(starting to cry) Oh God!
Monica	No.
Monica	Im gonna miss you so much.
Monica	I dont think theres anything.
Monica	Nope, shes perfect.
Rachel	Uh well, I guess Im not gonna miss the fact that youre never allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
Phoebe	Good thats a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Yknow? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Monica	Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Monica	Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Monica	Yeah, well I dont think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Monica	Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!
Monica	(on phone) Whats up?
Monica	Oh, put him on!
Ross	Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has created out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesnt feel like talking right now. Hes smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Rachel	You know what else Im not gonna miss? "Im Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Monica	"Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id better wash it and shrink it!"
Rachel	"Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Monica	"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Monica	Im not talking to her!
Monica	Well, maybe youre rightShe made fun of my phone pen!
Monica	Listen Rachel, I feel really bad aboutWhat are you doing? (She sees that Rachel is unpacking.)
Monica	What?!
Monica	It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Monica	Because its my apartment!
Monica	How about, youre moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants "No." and Monica chants "Yes.")
Rachel	Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)
Rachel	Great! Monicas moving!
Monica	(entering) I am not!
Rachel	Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.)
Monica	No Phoebe I am mad!
Monica	Well, this is the last box of your clothes. Im just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Monica	Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Yknow I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but yknow Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Rachel	Oh really? Like what Monica?
Monica	Yknow she has 147,000 pairs of boots
Monica	She lets you borrow them.
Monica	Do you wanna live outside?! Because its gettin cold! (To Phoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, shell fold down the pages of the things she thinks that Id like.
Monica	When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Monica	When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Monica	And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
Phoebe	Okay Rachel, I cant wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! Well have so much fun!!
Monica	Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it to get a better look.) Oh my God!
Monica	Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Monica	Im really gonna miss you.
Rachel	Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)
Monica	Thanks.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Bye.
Monica	She really left.
Monica	Thank you.
Monica	Can I ask you a question?
Monica	What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
Monica	Hey!
Monica	(jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
Monica	Oh, So you can move them!
Monica	It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Monica	Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Monica	Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Monica	Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Monica	Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Monica	Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Monica	(chuckles) Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Ross	Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Monica	Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Monica	So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Monica	Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Rachel	Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Monica	I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Monica	We'll see.
Chandler	Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monicas gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Ross	Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Ross	Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Ross	Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freakout. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Monica	(on phone) Hi!
Monica	Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Monica	It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Monica	Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Joey	(entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffee table...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!? (Points to Chandler) Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Chandler	Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Chandler	Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Monica	What?!
Monica	Why is Ross naked?
Monica	Naked?
Monica	Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Monica	Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Monica	Is it okay for me to come in now?
Monica	Why is everything different?
Monica	Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Monica	It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Monica	Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Monica	Of course!
Monica	All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloves on) Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Joey	(Grunting) Hmm. (Monica opens the front door and comes in.)
Monica	Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Chandler	Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally different situation.
Monica	Hey guys.
Monica	It was okay. Shes still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Monica	I dont think mine likes me either.
Monica	We should go.Scene: Rachels office, Phoebe hands Rachel a key card.]
Kim	Tell me everything.Scene; Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are on the couch. Ross walks in.]
Chandler and Monica	Hey.
Monica	What happened to your teeth.
Monica	Well, I think I shouldnt look directly at them.
Monica	Ross theyre really, really, really white.
Monica	How much longer?
Monica	Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Chandler	No, no no no. Youll be fine. (turning to Monica) Hillarys bind, right?
Monica	She will be after tonight.
Monica	Oh my god.
Monica	My God, Rachel, I cant believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, Im so jealous. (Chandler looks at her.)
Monica	Chandler, please, come on. Look at him. (Pointing to a picture of Ralph on a magazine,.)
Phoebe	Ohhh.Scene: Rosss Apartment, Ross and Monica are there.]
Monica	(Holding a shirt in front of Ross.) Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. (Ross has a big smile.) Nope. Okay, colors that dont work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Monica	Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldnt look so bright.
Monica	Im just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Monica	Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Monica	Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Monica	All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
Phoebe	Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (He smiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!Scene: Chandlers and Monicas apartment, Chandler and Monica are sitting at the kitchen table making potpourri sachets.]
Monica	Now are drawers will smell nice and we didnt waste these pantyhose.
Monica	Wait, were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Monica	You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. Youre right, Im sorry.
Monica	Yeah. Go over to Joeys. Go over to Joeys and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Monica	When girls hang out, we dont have pillow fights in our underwear. (Chandler gets a hurt look on his face.) Im sorry. We do. We do. I dont know why I said that.Scene: Joey and Janines apartment, Chandler walks in. Joey and Janine are knitting at the kitchen counter.]
Ross	Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, lets talk more about you. Hmm.Scene: Joey and Janines apartment, Joey and Monica are arranging flowers. Chandler walks in.]
Monica	Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Chandler	Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Monica	Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because Im going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Joey	Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)
Monica	(on phone) Okay, great! Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So guess whos coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Monica	(not amused by Chandlers joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my parents.
Monica	Yeah, and yknow, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we would eat around four.
Monica	Because they dont know were dating. (Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)
Monica	Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didnt.
Monica	(trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! Ill see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)
Monica	Well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. Im sorry.
Monica	Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre really sarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Monica	Look, I know that I shouldve told them. I know I shouldnt care what they think. Im sorry.
Monica	You really think thatll work?
Monica	(hugging Chandler) I dont think youll ever get my parents that drunk!
Chandler	Well Monica just told me that they dont.
Phoebe	Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachels dessert is...[about to say bad] so good that I eat all of it. Theres none left for anybody else!
Monica	Nothing.
Monica	No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Monica	Youre not gonna mess it up.
Rachel	Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butters done?
Monica	Well, its done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Monica	Whoa whoa whoa! Wherere you goin?
Monica	Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Monica	Youre not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and youre gonna eat here!
Monica	Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is its Chandler!
Mr. Geller	Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
Monica	Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Phoebe	Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And its making me look at him totally differently. Yknow, I mean he used to be just, yknow Jack Geller Monica and Rosss dad and now hes hes Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Monica	Yknow dad, Chandler is one of Rosss very best friends!
Monica	Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Chandler	Oh, yes. Well its very beautiful. Its cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I dont mean tight, I mean its not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]
Monica	(shocked) What?
Monica	Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler) were trying to get Ross stoned!
Monica	Ross, I cant believe youd do that!
Monica	You! Its not like its a big deal! You-you dont still do it or anything!
Monica	Dad, please dont pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-
Phoebe	Monica, leave him alone!
Monica	Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!
Rachel	Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Monica	Really?
Monica	Okay.
Monica	(faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey said) Mmmm! Its good!
Monica	Its so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one whos eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Mrs. Geller	(lying) Ive gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monicas room.
Monica	(again, lying) Im gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Monica	Ross? Lets go.
Monica	Alright, you know what? Thats it. Youve had your chance.
Monica	(out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Ross	(in a 5 year olds tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Monica	And Dad, yknow that mailman that you got fired? He didnt steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Ross	Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didnt break the porch swing, Monica did!
Monica	Ross hasnt worked at the museum for a year!
Ross	Monica and Chandler are living together!
Monica	Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Mrs. Geller	(rubbing her temples) Thats alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you werent supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, Im sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. (Phoebe makes a sad face.) Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
Mrs. Geller	Chandler! Youve been Rosss best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. (Ross gets disgusted.) And now youve taken on Monica as well. Well, I dont know what to say. Youre a wonderful human being.
Mr. Geller	No! Thank you! (Hugs Chandler) Monica, and Ross! I dont know what Im gonna do about the two of you!
Monica	Well actually, I-I didnt eat mine. Its still in the bathroom.
Mrs. Geller	(pointing to herself and Jack) Well we left ours in Monicas bedroom.
Ross	Wow, Monicas letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Monica	Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. Its about being with the people that you love.
Monica	Oh, here.
Monica	Aw, Im sorry sweetie that she doesnt feel the same way.
Monica	Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clarks New Years Rocking Eve?
Monica	Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Monica	We are there!
Janine	Thanks. (To Monica and Ross) Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
Monica	What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Monica	We are going to Dick Clarks New Years Rocking Eve!
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica and Ross	Scuse us
Rachel	We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler	No not okay, you cant look for Monicas presents!
Rachel	Chandler, arent you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Monica	Okay, here comes another camera.
Monica	If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
Monica	Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Joey	Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place dance) Looking good Gellers!
Monica	Hey, see that snippy guy over there? Hes the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Director	Next on the platforms are (He points to the right of Ross and Monica, so they dance over to where hes pointing to. He points away from them) you two! And (He points the other way, and Ross and Monica follow his arm. Again he points away.) You two!
Monica	Excuse me, sir, would it help if I werent wearing underpants?
Ross	Monica! (Pause) Would it?
Monica	Man, this sucks! Yknow if Mom and Dad dont see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, whos gonna be the losers then?
Monica	What?
Monica	Ross, we havent done the routine since middle school.
Monica	Was it really that good?
Monica	Okay, lets do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Monica	5 6 7 8!
Monica	Yes! (They run over to a platform)
Monica	I know! Hey, you havent been practising the routine, have you?
Monica	Me too!
Monica	Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we dont wanna look stupid!
Chandler	Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?
Chandler	I dont wanna know what Monica got me. Yknow? I mean, look, Im sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Chandler	Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I dont know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monicas face when I give her my present, and Im sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Monica	Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Monica	We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!
Monica	Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Monica	What? We could do it!
Monica	I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go. (She and Ross get up)
Monica and Ross	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Ross runs to be caught by Monica, but she moves out of the way)
Monica	I cant do it! (Ross falls into Monicas room)
Monica	Honey, we have been through this before!
Monica	You serious?!
Monica	Really?!
Janine	(to Monica and Rachel) Bye.
Monica	Bye. (Janine exits.)
Monica	I am so glad you said cooks.
Rachel	Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows her the picture.)
Monica	You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Monica	Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Monica	Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Monica	Its gotta be one of a kind. Yknow like umm, yknow uh, whats that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Monica	Im tellingIf you put that in her apartment youll never hear the end of it.
Monica	I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? Ill make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Monica	Joey, you dont have too!
Monica	Tomorrow!
Joey	What-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Chandler	And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnt afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Monica	What happened to Janine?
Janine	(entering from her room) Monica! Chandler! Im really-really sorry about tonight. I dont know if Joey told you; I just couldnt get out of going to this play. Im sorry. Have a great time.
Monica	Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Joey	Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
Monica	(loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?
Monica	Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
Chandler	Eh, theyre both good. I generally just go with, Monicas drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)
Monica	Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Monica	(from the hallway) I do not like that woman!
Monica	I am loud!
Monica	Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Monica	(loudly) I know!!!
Monica	Well, Id like to but, (extremely quietly) Im not sure we have time to go.
Monica	We owe you?!
Monica	We didnt give you any money! (Chandler is motioning, "No!")
Monica	Dont worry about it.
Monica	Absolutely!
Monica	Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)
Monica	(bursting in) I knew it!! Yknow, youre not so quiet yourself, missy!
Monica	(steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Lets go! Right now!
Joey	All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)
Chandler	(To Monica) Yknow I think you can take her.
Monica	(to Janine) Youd better hope I dont see you in the hallway!! (They exit.)
Monica	What did I tell you about the hall?!
Monica	Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
Monica	Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, Im glad we worked things out.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)
Monica	(hearing that) Thats it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with the garbage bag) Come on!
Monica	(chasing her) Youd better run!
Monica	I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Monica	That didnt work on mom, its not going to work on us.
Chandler	Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
Monica	No.
Monica	Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Chandler	Nah, Monicas watching some cooking show. Come on, I dont want to miss when they were skinny.
Monica	(relieved) Its only you.
Monica	So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a story?
Monica	Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Monica	Okay, Ive got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Monica	Me neither.
Monica	What?!
Monica	(visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Monica	Its wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Monica	Thats a good idea.
Monica	Do you know whats a bad idea?
Monica	Thats right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear something?
Monica	Its coming from the living room.
Joey	(sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back to bed.)
Monica	(entering) Hey, you guys.
Monica	(laughing) Oh, dont you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Rachel	Monica, what are you doing?
Monica	(laughing harder) Nothing, Im just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Monica	(angrily) It wasnt funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didnt you pick me?
Monica	That is completely untrue. You think Im high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point!
Rachel	(To Monica) Well, people are different.
Rachel	Oh my  you think Im a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? Youre not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think thats pretty strong, thats what I think. Come on, Monica, lets go to lunch. (She leaves)
Monica	(to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her coat and leaves, too.)
Monica	I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Monica	Im sick of Japanese. Were not going there.
Monica	All right.
Joey	Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
Monica	No, thank you.
Monica	Joey, what are you doing?
Joey	Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a whats wrong with you? look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)
Monica	Joey, do you work here?
Monica	Joey, whats going on. What didnt you tell us you work here?
Monica	So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Monica	Hah!
Monica	Well, then, Im okay with being high maintenance.
Monica	I am not high maintenance!
Chandler	Lets have Monica decide.
Ross	Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)
Monica	Why do I have to decide?
Monica	I cant be fair. Youre my boyfriend.
Chandler	(to Ross) Dont try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) Im your only chance to have a baby. Okay, lets go.
Monica	Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Monica	Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Monica	Do you want me to pick you?!
Monica	Continue.
Monica	All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.
Monica	You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
Monica	Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Monica	Hey, its Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Chandler	(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and(He falters and Monica prompts him.)generosity of spirit.
Monica	Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Monica	Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Monica	Ahhh! You are on my list.
Monica	(embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didnt even tell him to say that. (They hug). All right youre off my list.
Monica	(sits next to him) Phoebe, its okay that you dont want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Phoebe	(to Monica) Yknow, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Monica	I pick you, Phoebe.
Monica	(entering) Hey!
Monica	(congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I cant work if Im sick.
Monica	Im not sick!! I dont get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Rachel	Honey, no one thinks youre a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. (She notices something hanging from Monicas nose, as does Joey.)
Monica	(wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.)
Monica	I dont need a tissue! Im fine-d!
Monica	Im fine-d. Im fine-d! Yknow, its a really hard word to say.
Rachel	And you know Monica and Ross!
Monica	Rach? (Points to Jill.)
Monica	You bought a boat?
Monica	Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Lets do something crazy!
Monica	Okay, Ill rest. But yknow if Im going to bed, then youre coming with me.
Monica	(wiping her nose) Are you saying that you dont wanna get with this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesnt work all that well with the big robe.)
Monica	(in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)
Monica	Im with you Chandler! I mean I cant have sex with a sick person either, thats disgusting! But Im not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Monica	(still sick) Chandler!
Chandler	Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. Or at least shes trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!
Monica	(trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Monica	How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Monica	Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that Im not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.)
Monica	Im fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)
Ross	I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Monica	(entering) Chandler, I think Im sick.
Monica	Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)
Monica	Come on! I really need your help!
Monica	Fine, Ill rub it on myself.
Monica	Yeah?
Monica	Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Monica	I cant believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Monica	Not now, Im sick!
Monica	What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Monica	Okay, if you really wanna have sex
Monica	Worked like a charm.
Monica	(calling from the bathroom) Is someone there?
Monica	(entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Rosss apartment) Is that your sister?
Monica	God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Monica	Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im sure that nothing is gonna(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)
Monica	Joey we know you steal our food.
Monica	(To Rachel) Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Monica	(crying) This is my favorite part.
Monica	Chandler theres nothing wrong with crying! I mean you dont have to be so macho all the time.
Monica	Yeah youre right. I dont know what I was thinking.
Monica	Oh, Ive got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something from the dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Monica	Where were your parents?
Monica	Poor thing!
Monica	Youre jealous of Princess Caroline?
Monica	(noticing the bag Joeys carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Monica	Guys, whats going on?
Monica	Thats Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Monica	This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, yknow she had such a terrible childhood.
Monica	Yes, but you are dead inside.
Monica	Wh-what, why?
Monica	Yeah youre right, we cantwe shouldnt watch this.
Monica	(hands the tape back to Joey, but doesnt let him grab it) Yknow maybe a little bit!
Monica	Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Monica	Hey sweetie!
Monica	(picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Monica	Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Monica	Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you.
Monica	Stop it!
Monica	I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. (Points to her heart.)
Monica	Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you dont cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it wont matter to me.
Monica	And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And youre writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still cant shed one tiny tear, I know youll be crying a river inside.
Monica	What is wrong with you?!!!
Monica	What?! You cant shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
Monica	No you robot!!
Monica	No, I havent.
Chandler	(To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Monica	(To Chandler) Shhhh!!!
Monica	Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Monica	Bye.
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	Why did they get divorced?
Monica	And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure.
Ross	No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Rachel	Ohh, of course Monicas brother!
Rachel	Oh, its the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.) So, umm hows Monica?
Ross	Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, lets go see Monica!
Joey	So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Monica	Hes not boring! Hes just-hes just low key.
Monica's Boyfriend	(returning) Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte. (Hands it to Monica and sits down.)
Monica	Thanks.
Monica's Boyfriend	Yeah. Yknow, the hazelnut actually not a nut, its a seed.
Monica's Boyfriend	Can anyone else name a well known seed thats been masquerading as a nut?
Monica	Oh no! Whats the matter?
Monica's Boyfriend	Yknow what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Monica	Okay.
Monica's Boyfriend	(kisses her) Okay.
Monica	Bye.
Monica's Boyfriend	Bye-bye. (Gets up to leave.) Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut. (Exits.)
Monica	Maybe Joey doesnt have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
Monica	No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Monica	Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
Monica	Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	(gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug, which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!
Monica	You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Monica	Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since weve seen each other?
Monica	Rach, hes a friend of ours.
Monica	(getting up) Joey!
Monica	Ohhh! (Takes the plate.) No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
Joey	(turning and whispering to Monica) Shes not crazy is she?
Monica	No.
Monica	(laughs) You realize what you are dont you?
Monica	Youre his bitch.
Phoebe	(yelling from Monicas room) No-no!! No!!
Monica	(panicked) Oh wait! You didnt just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
Monica	What?!
Monica	Yes!!
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	Honey, having a heart attack is natures way of telling you to slow it down.
Monica	Lets take a walk. (They start to leave.) Yknow maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.)
Monica	Sorry. So hows it going with Joey?
Monica	Yeah! Shes right in there! (Points to Phoebes room.)
Monica	Oh my God! Thats great! Oh wow! (Hugs him.) Youre a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Monica	Wait a minute! (Quickly checks her pockets and pulls out) My last Kit-Kat bar!
Monica	Okay!!
Joey	(entering) Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know youre mad, but I just want to say Im sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Yknow? I mean, yknow how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Monica	Its not mayonnaise!!
Monica	Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Monica	Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Monica	Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married?
Monica	Well, youre not.
Monica	Yeah I can! (Laughs) And dont think I dont, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha! (Laughs.)
Rachel	Monica. Youve, youve done it right?
Monica	(giggles) Of course I have! What do you think, Im some 30 year old virgin?
Monica	Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Monica	Its not like, I havent any opportunities. I mean, yknow, Im just waiting for the perfect guy. Im seeing this guy Roger, all right? Hes not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Yknow, give him my flower.
Monica	Yknow what? You are right?!
Monica	Rachel! Im never gonna think its okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Monica	Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Monica	Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Monica	Put it out!!
Ross	(To Monica) Yeah, shes fired.
Monica	(handing her a cup) Here you go sweetie.
Monica	But, I put some honey in it.
Monica	Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Monica	I hope youre hungry, were starting with oysters. And yknow what they say about oysters, dont you?
Monica	No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Monica	People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)
Monica	And then were gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Monica	No-no-no, no! Its sensual!
Monica	Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!
Monica	I cant promise anything. (She starts to dig in.)
Monica	Yeah, me too.
Monica	Stop it!! Thats not funny!!
Monica	Im sorry, okay? It justtonight was supposed to be yknow, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Monica	You dont want to know what tonight was.
Monica	Well, tonight waswas going to be my first time.
Chandler	With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.) Oh my God!
Monica	All right relax Mr. Ive Had Sex Four Times!
Monica	How many?
Monica	I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Monica	No. Hes not a horrible guy.
Monica	Chandler, Im gonna die a virgin!
Monica	Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Monica	I was kidding.
Monica	No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?
Monica	Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if youre horrible, how would I know?
Monica	Its harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Monica	Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out another friend. (Points at herself.)
Monica	Noo!! Okay!!
Monica	Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Monica	I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs away.) Okay, whatcha doin there?! (Giggles.) Oh yknow what? Im sorry, this is just too weird.
Monica	What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)
Monica	Chandler?
Monica	Thats the couch.
Monica	I know! Ill tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Hey, check me out, Im a slut!
Monica	Oh I cant. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Monica	Are you okay?
Monica	Great! Its so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you Im all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Monica	Yknow, I dont have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. (He laughs halfheartedly) Are you sure youre okay?
Monica	Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Monica	What?!
Monica	Why would you do that?
Monica	Really?
Monica	Chandler!
Monica	There was just one woman, wasnt there?
Monica	Including me?
Chandler	Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Monica	(entering) Hey!
Monica	Oh, yeah.
Monica	Yes! Why, did youyou forget to make yours?
Monica	Okay. (They kiss.) Okay, I cant wait! This is going to be the best Valentines Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.) I cant believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Monica	Im just so excited to make the presents! (Chandler does another sarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) Shoot!
Ross	Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage and Ross screams) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.) Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Chandler	I cant figure out what to make Monica.
Chandler	Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Monica	Sure! Okay, you go first.
Monica	Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the couch.)
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Monica	Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Monica	Okay, you ready to open yours?
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Monica	Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See thats what this is about.
Monica	No! No, she doesnt. Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats uhtheyre sock rabbits. They are completely differentOkay! Okay! Okay! I didnt make it! Im sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that were supposed to make the presents!
Monica	No-no, its not okay! Its not! I mean you were just Youre so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Yknow Im just gonnaI, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
Monica	Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Yknow, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Monica	We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)
Monica	Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
Monica	I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Monica	Oop, your cake is ready!
Monica	Who the hell are you?!
Monica	The only problem!
Monica	Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Monica	I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Monica	The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Monica	You are just the sweetest. (They kiss.)
Chandler	No! Youre the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.)
Monica	(not buying it) Uh-huh.
Monica	(pointing to the kitchen) Yeah you will! (Points to the bedroom) And, are you kiddin me?!
Chandler	Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Monica	Okay.
Monica	I am!! (Enter her room and closes the door behind her.)
Monica	Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime.
Monica	Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Monica	Youre on the phone!
Monica	Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)
Monica	Oh well, its not so bad.
Monica	Joey! Hes working! (To Chandler) You would look good in that.
Monica	Isnt that mine?
Monica	(pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Wow! So, now youre going on a date with this girl?
Monica	Youre right, Im sorry. Its not like youre yknow, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Monica	You dated her!
Monica	All right, well why dont I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Monica	Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Monica	I know! Now look, theres only one problem though. Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys.
Monica	So Rach! Youre the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, youll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, yknow, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Rachel	I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
Monica	Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Phoebe	Thanks Monica!
Monica	Does that smell bother you?
Monica	Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.
Monica	Okay!
Monica	Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) Its for you. Its the fire inspector.
Ross	We had such a great time! Shes-shes incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasnt. It wasnt at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.) (To Monica) A concept lost on some people!
Monica	So its okay to date a student.
Monica	Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents.
Monica	Joey that is so sweet.
Monica	What?! Youre going out with her again!
Monica	Joey! You didnt even know her!
Monica	Hey! Hows it goin?
Monica	Yes it has! I made cookies!
Monica	But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.
Monica	(pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Monica	Okay!
Monica	(opening the door) What are you doing?
Phoebe	Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Phoebe	(To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
Phoebe	No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!
Phoebe	God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monicas.)
Monica	Whats the charity?
Monica	Does Ralph mumble when youre not paying attention?
Chandler	(laughs) Isnt she cute? (On Monicas death stare) No!
Monica	Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Monica	Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Yknow, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Monica	Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Monica	Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	(laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	Well, uh yknow, our guy works with Chandler and hes really nice and smart and hes a great dresser!
Monica	Youre not supposed to look!
Monica	All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
Monica	Our guys a great dancer!
Monica	(To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Monica	Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Monica	Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break youre doing frat guys.
Monica	And slept with the professor.
Monica	Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandlers work!
Monica	Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Monica	Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Chandler	(To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.
Monica	All right guys stop it. Rachel, were very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And yknow what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
Monica	In 1981 you were 13!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Were really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Monica	Youre gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Monica	Eldad, this is Rachel.
Chandler	There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)
Monica	Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!
Monica	No! You cant do that!
Monica	(stopping him) Sit down! Were winning!
Monica	Rachel! Rachel! You havent touched Eldads hair!
Chandler	It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)
Monica	Thats right Patrick, bye-bye!
Monica	What?
Joey	I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt. Monica: (trying not to laugh) Oh my God. Joey: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! Ross: You're right, you're right, it is.
Monica	Yes.
Monica	Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Monica	Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Monica	That's your call.
Monica	Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Monica	They'r alright.
Monica	No really, they're OK.
Monica	Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Monica	I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]
Rachel	(on the phone) Monica, Im quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didnt even buy it! (Pause) Im telling you Im quitting! Thats it! Im talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up.)
Monica	Well, what happened?
Monica	Was it...
Chandler	Oh come on guys, its not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it werent for (struggles to get this out) Monicas allergies. (The duck quacks.) Youre right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs, then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joeys not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? (Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)
Monica	(startled) Ahh! Arent you dressed yet?
Monica	Were supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Monica	Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Chandler	Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)
Monica	Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has a disgusted look on his face.) Apparently youre not very good at it! I
Monica	Yknow what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case (Chandler gets that disgusted look back.) Okay
Ross	It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means you are, Y-O-U-R means your!
Monica	You had no right to go out with him.
Monica	You sold me out.
Monica	Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
Rachel	Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
Monica	Did you just flick me?
Rachel	OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
Monica	Fine!
Chandler	(To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)
Monica	(To Chandler) You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Monica	I think our lovers spat will start a little early this month.
Monica	We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Monica	Ross!!
Monica	How crazy that wed run into you!
Ross	Oh God, thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens Id like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Monica	(obviously attracted to him) Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Ross	Okay umm, why dont we all take a seat, yknow? And uh, and Ill get us all some uh some coffees(He goes to pull out Elizabeths chair, but Paul steps in)Yeah, why dont you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Yknow? Whatever pops into your head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)
Monica	Yknow, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, cause usually hes got the childrens hospital.
Phoebe	Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)
Elizabeth	So uh, Monica is Rosss sister.
Monica	And hes a great brother!
Monica	Ohh!
Monica	No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Monica	You said the baby.
Monica	Why would the little girl creep you out?
Monica	What?! Excuse me!
Phoebe	And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. (Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as its a compliment.
Monica	How was your first day?
Monica	Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.
Monica	No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Monica	Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.
Monica	Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Monica	Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, Ill just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Monica	(writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Monica	(still writing) Phyllis sees what Im doing.
Monica	Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Monica	We said six!
Monica	Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"
Monica	Ugh!
Monica	What time?
Chandler	(To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (Hes wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
Monica	Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Monica	Hi!
Monica	Oh thats great!
Monica	I mean think about all the money that youre gonna make!
Monica	Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Monica	Oh, I love museums!
Monica	Soakin up all the culture.
Monica	Where do you want to start?
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldnt put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! (Points to both places.) I mean youd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.)
The Museum Official	(To Monica) May I help you?
Rachel	Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Monica	What?! Are you crazy?! Im not getting married! Im not even engaged.
Monica	Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Monica	Phoebe, that stuff is
Chandler	(on machine) Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we are.
The Museum Official	(on phone) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available (Chandler runs to answer the phone.)
Monica	Hi, honey.
Monica	What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
The Museum Official	(on machine) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.
Monica	Oh no!
Monica	Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!
Monica	NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Monica	Phoebe!
Monica	Have you seen Chandler?!
Monica	The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How bad is this?!
Monica	I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I cant find him anywhere!
Monica	Well, Im never gonna listen to you again, thats for sure! (Mimicking her.) "Yknow, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Monica	Well Rachels not here! (Runs out.)
Monica	(going over to him) Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Monica	Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, whats the harm in that?
Monica	Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
Monica	It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.
Monica	Really?
Monica	I know! I know.
Monica	Im gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that youre back. I was really worried about you. (Exits.)
Phoebe	I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Chandler	Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I cant figure this out! Its so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah! Paper cut!
Chandler	No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.
Monica	Still crying?
Monica	Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Monica	I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one. Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.
Monica	Oh, we have some
Phoebe	I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Chandler	No, its not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monicas face when I gave it to her, yknow? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing Im gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure its perfect.
Chandler	Guys? (They ignore him.) Ive got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) Im gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Chandler	Im gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Ross	Chandlers gonna ask Monica to marry him!
Monica	(entering) Hey!
Phoebe	(with her mouthful) Hi Monica.
Chandler	(with his mouthful) Hi Monica.
Rachel	Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Chandler	(glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler cant go. Were going to dinner remember?!
Monica	Whats the big deal?
Monica	Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Monica	Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Monica	Hi guys.
Chandler	(To Monica) You are beautiful.
Monica	Oh, thank you! (The gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears knowing glances.) (Monica giggles.) Whats going on?
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	Are you okay?
Monica	Yeah. Im okay. Im actuallyIm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Monica	(laughs) Are you sure youre okay?
Monica	Ohh thats sweet!
Monica	(interrupting him) Oh my God!
Monica	Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richards back.)
Monica	Oh God, maybe he wont see us. Richard!
Richard	(approaching them with a woman in tow) Monica! Chandler!
Monica	Hey, its good to see you!
Monica	YeahOh thats right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Richard	Oh, Im sorry. (Introduces them.) Lisa, (nodding at each) Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Monica	Chandler, wh-why dont we sit down?
Monica	(to Richard) Its good to see you
Matire'd	(motioning to the empty table next to Monica and Chandlers) Or if you prefer, this table is available.
Monica	And so, were hiding in the bathroom.
Richard	And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Monica	So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know theyre going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Monica	Ohh.
Monica	I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Monica	Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just cant get out of!
Monica	Why dont you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean thats what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and pauses) weighing stuff.
Monica	If the school finds out youre fired.
Monica	Shes leaving for three months.
Monica	Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in consideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didnt you?!
Monica	Okay well I thinkthats your answer.
Monica	Why do you want to see my hand?
Monica	(suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebes wishes.)
Monica	(entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Rachel	(entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God youre here, let me see your hand!!
Monica	(entering) Hi guys!
Monica	What are you up too?
Monica	Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Monica	Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Monica	Okay well thats good to know.
Waitress	Hey Monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
Monica	Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)
Monica	Richard!
Monica	Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So whats up?
Monica	Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Monica	What uhWhat did youWhat?!
Monica	Yknow youre really not supposed to be back here!
Monica	Oh God (Starts looking around.) Why dont they put chairs back here?!
Monica	What the Yes youre too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Monica	What were you doing in Africa?
Monica	Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I Im sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Monica	Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, Im the one thats making him wait!
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	Why? Because of the government.
Rachel	Isnt it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin married.
Monica	So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you?
Monica	Yeah, but thats pigs not people!
Monica	Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Monica	Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Monica	Yknow what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Rachel	Yeah, Im pretty confident about that. Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
Joey	Hey Monica!
Monica	Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Monica	Yeah, its great.
Monica	Im just having one of those days where you realize youre in a dead-end relationship!
Monica	Its not like I want to get married tomorrow! Its just that I-Id like to believe that Im in a relationship thats actually going somewhere, that Im not just wasting my time!
Monica	No I dont know Chandler! Not anymore! Its like its like somethings changed.
Monica	I didnt change!
Monica	What?!
Monica	Is that some kind of boat talk?
Monica	What does he think? Does he think Im just gonna wait around for nothing?
Joey	Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Monica	(starts for the door) Well theres some people who do want to marry me.
Monica	Yeah! Richard!
Joey	R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!
Monica	Thats right.
Monica	You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! That-that hes against marriage and always will be!
Joey	Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Joey	Look, Chandler I dont think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Monica	Hi.
Monica	I dont know why Im here.
Monica	I dont know.
Monica	(entering) Chandler is such an idiot!
Monica	Yeah, Ill have a scotch
Monica	(moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?
Monica	No thats, thats okay.
Richard	So Monica let me ask you a question. Yknow, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Monica	Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Monica	Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I dont like my new eye doctor.
Monica	Edward Nevski?
Monica	No.
Monica	But getting over was the hardest thing that Ive ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Monica	(to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Monica	Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.
Monica	I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-ups apartment! Yknow, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Monica	Yknow, lets face it, Im not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I dont want that!
Monica	Fair? Please dont even talk to me about fair! Fair wouldve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair wouldve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Monica	Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks up at his eyes.) I dont knUmm. I dont know. Umm
Monica	Yknow, I-I I have to figuresome stYknow, some stuff before I can
Richard	Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. (Pause) Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. Ill be here. Not smoking. (Monica leaves.)
Chandler	(examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Chandler	I cant talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Monica	You wanted it to be a surprise.
Monica	Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As tofall in love with my bestmy best Theres a reason why girls dont do this!
Chandler	Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?
Monica	Yes.
Monica	I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Monica	Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) Were engaged!!!
Monica	Oh
Ross	I found a note on my door, "Come to Monicas quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Chandler	Monica and I are engaged.
Monica	(yelling at the top of her lungs) Im engaged!!!!!! Im engaged!!!!
Monica	Im getting married!!!! Im gonna be a bride!!!! (Someone else yells at her.) No, I will not shut up because Im engaged! (He yells again.) Ohh, big talk! Huh, why dont you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! (Chandler starts to look worried.) Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Monica	Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a toast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say thatI love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night. I mean it just wouldnt be myour-our night, if you all werent here to celebrate with meusDamnit!
Chandler	Its okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.
Monica	Awww, come onwaitstop it. Okay, to Monica.
Chandler	To Monica!
Rachel	(To Monica) Yeah, youre on your own.
Monica	Yknow what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Monica	Okay everybody, lets go! Lets go!
Monica	(looking at her hand) Yknow what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) Youre not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)
Monica	Yeah, but I dont think we have time.
Monica	(lustily) Lets do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.)
Monica	(chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
Monica	Phoebe!
Ross	Wow! Happy Monicas night!
Monica	Phoebe! Come on! Lets go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why arent you dressed yet?!
Monica	(grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, Ill tell you what, if you get ready now Ill let you play it at the wedding.
Monica	Fair enough, now go get ready!
Monica	Ill get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating my(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.) Im sorry, uh apparently Ive opened the door to the past.
Ross	Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw
Monica	(interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Monica	See, Ive been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people Im only planning on doing this once. So, uh yknow, maybe this is selfish and Im sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Monica	No its not! No! No! Now its about you and Ross getting back together!
Monica	See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Monica	Thats true.
Monica	Thunder being stolen!!
Rachel	Okay come on Phoebe, its nothing! Monica, come on!
Ross	And; people thinking its huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!
Monica	Well, were still talking about it, arent we?
Joey	Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Monica	Yes that would be lovely.
Monica	Yknow what? I-I think that umm, I dont feel like going to The Plaza.
Rachel	Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look
Monica	No-no, I-I really dont want to talk about it! I dont! (To Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)
Phoebe	Well, I dont think Monica is gonna take this away.
Rachel	What do you think Monica mean when she said she didnt want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Rachel	Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!
Monica	I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical.
Chandler	Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Monica	Paris?
Monica	Keep talking.
Monica	I love you!
Monica	(in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.
Monica	(opening the door) Hi Pheebs, whats up? (She enters.)
Monica	What?!
Monica	Yes.
Rachel	Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone, especially me?
Chandler	What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Monica	Well, lets just say its not the first time youve stolen my thunder.
Rachel	Monica, what are you talking about?
Monica	My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Monica	Its all everybody at the party could talk about!
Rachel	Monica, yknow what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
Monica	(gasps) We had a characturist!
Rachel	Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Monica	And yet, here we are doing it again.
Rachel	Ugh, Monica I dont want to steal your stupid thunder!
Monica	Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Monica	I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Monica	Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Rachel	(ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Monica	I dont know! I dontmaybe youre feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought youd get married first! Maybe you cant stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Monica	(yelling after them) I cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Chandler	Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
Monica	(outside the door) Its Monica, open up!
Rachel	Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?
Monica	I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement Im going to announce that Im pregnant!
Rachel	All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Monica	I know why!
Monica	Okay! Why?!
Monica	What do you mean?
Monica	(starting to cry) Im sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.)
Monica	(entering from her room) Oww!
Monica	I dont know, my hand feels weird. I guess its because, Im engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?
Monica	Okay! (Runs off.)
Monica	(returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3" 3-ring binder on the table.)
Monica	This baby has got everything. Take yknow, locations for instance. (She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Phoebe	I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler.
Ross	Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Monica	All right, so I havent cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Monica	All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Monica	A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Chandler	Well, you couldnt get them anyway. Ian doesnt plan anymore and Derrick (Off of Rachel and Monicas looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldnt know.
Monica	Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Monica	Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Monica	Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)
Chandler	Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just think theyre a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.
Monica	Oh my God! Its like one mind.
Phoebe	Whats the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandlers!
Monica	Oh dad, really you dont need to
Monica	Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
Monica	Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. (Chandler and her laugh, but her parents dont.) What?
Monica	What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?
Monica	I dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
Monica	You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Monica	What about when I started dating Chandler?
Monica	I cant believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Monica	I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Monica	My parents spent the money for our wedding!
Monica	No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Rachel	No, yknow what? Its gonna be okay. I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yknow? And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)
Monica	How? I dont have any money.
Monica	How much?
Chandler	Well, close to (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)
Monica	Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Monica	Its enough for wedding scenario eight.
Monica	(To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Monica	This is the most special day of our lives.
Monica	Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, were only gonna get married once.
Monica	You-youre gonna have to put your foot down?
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Listen umm, Ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Monica	Eh, you work for that.
Monica	You do?!
Monica	Oh, youre so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Monica	You thought about that?
Monica	How many kids were we gonna have?
Monica	What else did you think about?
Monica	(laughs) Yknow what? I-I dont want a big, fancy wedding.
Monica	No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Monica	Uh-hmm.
Monica	I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Monica	Oh good.
Monica	Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	Of course! (She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of the gang.)
Monica	(interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we dont want to deprive them of that joy.
Monica	Oh, I already have one.
Monica	Hey, I know I what I want!
Monica	No, you dont want this. I want to have your grandmothers cookie recipe.
Monica	Uh-huh, yeah.
Monica	I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Monica	Okay. Im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds best chocolate chip cookies.
Monica	Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Monica	What?
Monica	Wow! Thats great! Dad must really like you, he doesnt ask just anyone to play.
Monica	This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Monica	Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Monica	He hates to lose.
Monica	Whats wrong Phoebe?
Monica	No!! Why didnt you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Phoebe	Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)
Monica	(To Chandler) This is what happens when you dont register for gifts!
Monica	No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Monica	Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Monica	All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Monica	You dont? (Laughs) Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
Monica	Hey! How was sailing?
Phoebe	I cant believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmothers legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Monica	Hey! How was it?
Monica	Oh my God Chandler! I cant believe it!
Monica	You gave my father a lap dance!
Monica	Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care. He probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!
Ross	Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Monica	I wasnt escaping.
Monica	I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Monica	(takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) Im sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, Ill call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)
Ross	(To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Monica	Okay, heres batch 22. Ohh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Monica	Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Monica	No, just a Friday night.
Monica	The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Monica	Well, Ive tried everything. I give up. I guess Im not gonna be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Monica	Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?
Monica	What was her name?
Monica	Nestle Tollhouse?!
Monica	(grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)
Monica	I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Mac	(on TV) Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives dont mix. (Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel, Chandler, and Monica arent amused.)
Monica	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, its your mom. (Hands him the phone.)
Monica	Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Monica	And I have costumes.
Monica	Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Rachel	Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Monica	Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Monica	Im so happy for you!
Monica	What?!
Monica	Oooh!
Chandler	No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
Phoebe	(To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Monica	(To Chandler) Hey sweetie.
Monica	I cant tell you. Its a secret.
Monica	Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.
Monica	Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Monica	If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Oh my God. He threw up?
Chandler	No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebes secret?
Monica	Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebes old massage place is getting fired.
Monica	Thats right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.
Chandler	Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Dont show this to Monica! And dont tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Monica	Hey! Good, youre home!
Monica	Hey baby. (Kisses him.)
Monica	I made you a surprise.
Monica	Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story Ive had such a craving for them.
Monica	Ross!
Monica	No! No. Theyre umm Theyre just uhground beef smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)
Monica	Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Ross	Eh, either way Ill pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still cant eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) Whats so funny?!
Monica	(trying not to laugh) Im not laughing.
Chandler	Nancy Thompsons getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
Ross	(To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! Its not like I choose to do it! Its not likeIts not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
Monica	Youre right. I mean Im sorry. Yeah, I shouldnt be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler laughing.)
Ross	Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Monica	(running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!
Monica	(To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Monica	Oh my God! (Laughing)
Monica	I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!
Ross	Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box shed made.
Monica	Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Ross	Monica couldnt tell time til she was 13!
Monica	Its hard for some people!
Chandler	(To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wowwhoa!
Monica	Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Monica	Ohh, Im sorry I couldnt think of anymore for Ross!
Monica	Yknow, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
Chandler	(To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
Monica	No!
Monica	I dont know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)
Monica	Yeah?
Monica	Ohh, absolutely.
Monica	Yeah, definitely!
Monica	Then, Id steer clear of Phoebe.
Ross	Man! (Monica mouths, "Im sorry.")
Monica	Whats the matter?
Monica	Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us.
Monica	Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!
Monica	(looking at one) Oh, heres a great one.
Monica	I know, but look at me all tan.
Monica	Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Yknow (Does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.)
Monica	Chandler what do you say?
The Photographer	(taking pictures) Great! Thats great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Monica	Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
Monica	Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.
Monica	Or not.
Monica	I know. Lets try a lookof far offwonderment. Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" (The photographer laughs.) Hey! Dont laugh at him! Hes my drowning moron!
Monica	Thats it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
Monica	They cant all be bad. (To Chandler) Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Monica	Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Joey	I know, Monica told me.
Monica	(seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!
Monica	Are you okay?
Monica	What?!
Monica	Chandler, what were you thinking?
Monica	Chandler?
Monica	Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Monica	Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)
Phoebe	You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)
Monica	Yeah, we really do!
Monica	Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Monica	Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Monica	First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me
Monica	Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
Monica	If Phoebe were my maid of honor
Monica	Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Monica	(laughs) Well thats the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Monica	Because then I dont have to!
Monica	Im really not deciding!
Monica	Yeah thats right.
Phoebe	Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!
Rachel	Oh my God Phoebe! I mean Im justWait a minute. If Im your maid of honor that means you are Monicas.
Rachel	Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monicas!
Rachel	Okay. Okay. Itssince youve never done it before you can be Monicas made of honor.
Monica	Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then sheshe wished me good luck.
Monica	No, its more like a (sarcastically) good luck.
Monica	She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Monica	Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Monica	Did you break up with her?
Monica	Why?
Monica	Fat?!
Monica	You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Monica	Well, apparently she does.
Chandler	Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Rachel	Phoebe is gonna be Monicas maid of honor!
Monica	Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Monica	Youre Lewis Posin.
Monica	Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Monica	No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Yknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Monica	No, I know. But yknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Ross	Because its the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel youre up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: Youre with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)
Rachel	Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Yknow, its-its just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You dont get to keep the gifts.
Joey	(out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Joey	Were now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Ross	(playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember that(Phoebe screams and tackles him)Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Rachel	Okay! Okay! Umm, Websters Dictionary defines marriage as (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Rachel	Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, Ive known them separately and Ive known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Phoebe	Okay, I cant believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)
Chandler	(To Monica) Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
Monica	Its pretty clear.
Rachel	Well yknow what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)
Monica	Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.
Monica	All right, II have to ask.
Monica	Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Monica	Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
Monica	In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thats not the point.
Monica	Well Thats not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Monica	How?
Monica	What if I have babies, okay? I mean Im gonna look different. Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are!
Chandler	Look you have to realize I dont think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Monica	Keep going.
Monica	Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Monica	I love you. (They hug and kiss.)
Rachel	Yeah. Yeah, and yknow you-you deserve to win. And-and yknow I was thinking about it, if-if youre Monicas maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Rachel	Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, yknow just in case
Rachel	Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and heres a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Yknow I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Rachel	Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monicas something borrowed and its blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah
Phoebe	Yknow Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monicas made of honor.
Monica	(entering) Hey, whats going on?
Monica	(gasps) Ohh, wow! Thats great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; well get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? Im so excited! (Runs out leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)
Monica	She sent the chicken back again?!
Monica	Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Monica	(to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around to face the planets most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of course. Shes the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.
Monica	Im fine.
Janice	(notices Monicas engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your finger?! Im blind!
Monica	Oh Uh
Monica	Well, she saw the ring.
Monica	Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Monica	Well, she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Monica	Huh?
Monica	Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Monica	Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it wont be so bad.
Monica	Oh my God, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Monica	Really?
Monica	So-so you wouldve just lied?
Monica	Would it really have been that easy?
Monica	Good, so do it Saturday night because were going to dinner with her and Clark.
Monica	He might still show up.
Monica	Is that all?
Monica	Its actually going to be just family.
Monica	What are we gonna do?
Chandler	(To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Monica	Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Monica	(To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice arent they?
Monica	Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Monica	Well justwell just let her stay.
Monica	Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Monica	I never stop thinking about it.
Chandler	Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Monica	Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Monica	Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Monica	Thats right. Thats right. And that is why you cant stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding.
Monica	I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Janice	Ohmy Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, Ill go. (Starts for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)
Chandler	I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
Chandler	Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).
Monica	It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Monica	Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (Thats true in so many ways, trust me, Ive lived in one and been to the other.)
Monica	'Cause you invited your assistant.
Monica	Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Monica	Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but I still do.
Monica	All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Chandler	I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!
Monica	(entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
Monica	Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Monica	Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)
Monica	Rosss apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
Monica	That's my pie!
Monica	Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Monica	We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Monica	Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Monica	Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Monica	Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monicas apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Monica	I'll be right there!
Monica	(walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
Monica	Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Monica	Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Monica	Don't do what?
Monica	1250.
Phoebe	All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Rosss. We'll be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Monica	When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Rachel	(to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Monica	Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-hes obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Monica	Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Monica	Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Monica	Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!
Monica	That's not gonna work.
Monica	Hey! I didn't know either.
Monica	Yeah, I knew.
Monica	Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Chandler	(comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?
Ross	Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Ross	Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friendPhyllistake away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Chandler	Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Monica	Hi, honey.
Monica	What? Why, why would...
Phoebe	(interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Monica	That's right, she came back all by herself.
Monica	Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, andit bent.
Monica	Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Monica	Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Monica	Im gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table) on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Monica	See? This is exactly why Im making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Monica	Where you can make out with your assistant.
Monica	Oh yeah, whats the plan?
Monica	Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Monica	Did you two
Rachel	Oh Monica come on, yknow I dont sleep with guys on the first date!
Monica	Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire
Monica	Okay.
Monica	The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Monica	Joey!!
Monica	Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Monica	They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!! (Starts to do so.)
Monica	Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Ross	Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a crime wave!! (Monica runs to make more candy.) Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Monica	(turning a light on) Who is that?!
Chandler	Dont worry, Im brave! I am brave! II am brave! (They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.) Can you tell me who is there please?
Monica	Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Monica	Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Chandler	I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
Monica	Umm, listen I am sorry, but Ill put some out first thing in the morning.
Monica	Um-hmm.
Gary	(looking at Monica.) Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you!
Chandler	Mm! Night Gar! (Monica closes the door.)
Monica	Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Monica	Oh yeah! I saw her walkin it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Monica	Umm, can we see you ride it?
Monica	See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Monica	Im sorry, I cant help you. See? (Points to her new sign.) Rules are rules.
Monica	No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell em?
Monica	Some people have been saying its yknow little drops of heaven, but whatever.
Monica	(still talking to the woman) All right, Ill do it just this once! But you cant tell anybody!
The Woman	(after Monica gives her the candy) Thank you.
Monica	(closing the door) Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!
Monica	Hmm?
Monica	But they like it!
Monica	Maybe.
Monica	Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)
Monica	Well, theyre just gonna have to wait arent they? Ive only got two hands!!
Monica	No! You dont know the system! Therell be nobody messing with the system!
Monica	(opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Monica	(To Chandler) Thank you.
Monica	Did you smoke?
Monica	Im fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Monica	Betrothed (Corrects him)
Monica	(Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?
Monica	Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Rachel	(to Monica) Did you know he was in there?
Monica	No.
Monica	About a half an hour.
Monica	No.
Monica	Bing's weird.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Chandler	No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Monica	Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Monica	Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Phoebe	Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica look surprised) Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Yknow? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)
Monica	I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Monica	(pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.
Monica	No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Monica	You've got to be smooth about it.
Chandler	Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
Monica	How did it go?
Monica	It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Monica	I don't know.
Monica	We'd be eating our soup right now.
Monica	(sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Chandler	Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.
Monica	It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Monica	Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Phoebe	Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Phoebe	Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Monica	What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Ross	(to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Monica	Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way fromTexas.
Monica	Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Ross	(to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Monica	Come on Ben.
Chandler	You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!
Monica	Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Monica	(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
Monica	Yes, is that okay?
Monica	No.
Ross	The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, its time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben, and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
Ross	Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Monica	What are you talking about?
Monica	You were invited?!
Monica	My God, I cant believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Monica	Yeah, well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadnt have stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go too.
Chandler	I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then sushes him.)
Ross	Hey, yknow what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica shakes her head in disgust.)
Monica	Joey, that papers like a year old!
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!
Monica	(disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! Thats not the reason shes not inviting me!
Monica	Joan?
Monica	Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasnt invited and you got "and guest?!"
Monica	Wait a minute, yknow, youre bringing me!
Monica	Why not?!
Monica	Because! Shes my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! Were family yknow? Well thats important to me.
Monica	(laughs) Well see.
Monica	David who?
Monica	Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	So! Hell understand!
Phoebe	No he wont. And thats not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now yknow what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I dont have my principles, I dont have anything!
Monica	God, you are so strong.
Chandler	Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Chandler	Thats what Monica said.
Monica	Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut. (To the couple sitting to her right.) Hi!
Monica	Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Monica	Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Ross	(To Monica) Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
Monica	(to the couple on her left) So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Monica	Okay, youre fine.
Rachel	Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Rachel	What? Oh, well then yknow what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Monica	Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me? (Starts to get up and great Frannie.)
Monica	Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Ross	That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on Frannies shoulder.)
Frannie	(turning around) Monica! What
Monica	Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Monica	You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! (Frannies husband walks up.) Stuart!
Monica	Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Ross	Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monicas wrap and walks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)
Monica	(looking up) Ross, whens this comet thing start?
Monica	Okay, weve been out here for two hours and we havent seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandlers getting chilly. (She walks over to where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)
Joey	Then why are you wearing Monicas jacket?
Chandler	Because its flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.)
Chandler	(whispering) Monica!
Monica	Shes sleeping.
Monica	Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is whats going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Chandler	Sorry, I justcant sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover Im like(Fake snores.)
Monica	It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Chandler	What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
Ross	Rachel!! Monica!!
Chandler	Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) Im sorry, I thought maybe Id make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Monica	With a wok? (Chandlers holding a wok.) I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Monica	Here, let me make the milk, Im up anyway.
Monica	Okay that does sound like fun.
Monica	The second sister dies?!
Monica	The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Monica	Okay, heres your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She sees that Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)
Monica	Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? Im sorry. Here. (Hands the mug of milk to him.)
Monica	Are you still awake?
Monica	You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesnt respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as were both up
Chandler	(intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope youre not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Monica	What?! What are you doing?!
Monica	Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Monica	Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)
Chandler	(turning the light back on) Monica?
Monica	What?!
Monica	Okay. Okay, Im ready. Come on big fella!
Monica	Give me the good stuff.
Chandler	Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Dont fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesnt move as he gets out of bed and as hes heading for the door.) And I probably wont spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Monica	Okay, Im up! Im up!
The Fireman	The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Monica	That really was some of your best work.
Monica	I have to be up in seven minutes.
Monica	Really?!
Monica	Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!
Monica	(entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section
Monica	Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)
Monica	I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Ross	(on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! (Listens) Yes were surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?
Monica	Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, its time the velvet ropes came down.
Monica	Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victorias Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Monica	As much as they love you?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	That was me and Ross.
Monica	Oh thats a great idea. Youre really good on the phone.
Phoebe	Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Yknow, I probably wouldnt have to say spank as much. (Monica and Ross are shocked.)
Ross	(entering with Monica) Hey!
Ross	(To Monica) Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Monica	Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories
Monica	I used to love to play restaurant.
Monica	Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! (She goes to the attic.)
Mr. Geller	I think I accidentally used Monicas boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Ross	Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, were gonna give her some! Okay, grabgrab some empty boxes. Okay? Well-well take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers well-well put em in their.
Monica	Hey guys! Hey!
Monica	Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Monica	(wary) Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Monica	Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding it up.)
Monica	(looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Monica	(holding up a glove) Oh, an old glove?
Monica	Wow! Look at this! (Picking up a shirt.) I cant believe I even fit into this shirt! (She holds it up and it reads: Tyrannosaurus Ross.) (She turns it around and looks at it.) Oh, this is yours. (Hands it to Ross.)
Monica	(holding up a small cowboy hat) This isnt mine. (Sets it down and looks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isnt, this isnt my stuff! Ugh, Ross! (Grabs and holds up a doll.) These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Monica	What?
Monica	Just mine?
Monica	So why-why wasnt Rosss stuff ruined? (Pause) And if you say the words medical marvel Im going to Easy Bake your head!
Monica	So wait, Rosss stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Monica	I cant believe this! (Storms out.)
Monica	Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. (She picks up some kind of furry thing.) It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I dont even know what it is! Ohh, its still soft. (She rubs it against her cheek.) What do you think this is?
Monica	How do you think I am?! Youve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
Monica	(opening it) Whats this?
Monica	(shocked) What?!
Monica	Wait, youre giving me your Porsche, youre kidding me right?!
Mr. Geller	(To Monica) Why dont we take it for a spin?
Monica	All right!
Monica	(entering) Hey guys!
Monica	Do you guys know what happened to Chandlers barca lounger?
Monica	Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca loungers gone?! This is the best day ever! (Runs out.)
Monica	Happy birthday!!!
Monica	Its your birthday!
Chandler	(To Monica) Shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Phoebe	Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Monica	Chocolate-chip pancakes!
Monica	They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Monica	Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends
Phoebe	I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! Thats it!! Thats everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head into Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)
Rachel	Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Monica	Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Monica	I cant believe you bought this.
Monica	All right Rach, for what its worth, I think that youre doing great. I mean yknow lets face it, no one handles this well.
Monica	Werent you asked to leave sonny?
Chandler	(To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monicas gonna be here any minute!
Monica	Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)
Monica	Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and Joeys doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment. She manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. (Pause) I wanna puke on you later!
Monica	Noo!!!
Monica	Noo!!
Monica	Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of.
Monica	Really?! You promise?
Monica	Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)
Monica	What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.)
Monica	Okay. I can do that.
Monica	Ross, just forget about it. This guys got you totally wedged in.
Chandler	Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Monica	Yay!
Monica	(sees someone) Paul!
Monica	Phil!
Chandler	Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay, (catches her) youre doing great. Youre doing great. Youre doing fine.
Chandler	Monicas a little drunk.
Phoebe	Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Monica	Awwwww (Giggles.)
Chandler	(To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesnt want her parents to know shes drunk.
Phoebe	Ohh! All right! All right. Heres what well do, Ill get twice as drunk as Monica and then no ones will even notice her.
Chandler	Monicas wasted.
Joey	Yep. (Starts for Monicas room, but Chandler stops him.)
Rachel	Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! Its better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) Thats funny, yeah!
Monica	All you had to do was buy the card!
Monica	Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To Chandler) Look all you want, its happening!
Ross	(To Monica) Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.
Chandler	(To Monica) How are you feeling?
Monica	You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! (Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)
Chandler	(To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone.
Mrs. Geller	Speech! Come on Monica!
Monica	I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends
Monica	I really like to say that Im-um (Pause) Yknow what Id really like to say? Im drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.) Thats right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the camera out of his dads hands.) And guess what! Ive been drunk before! And Ive smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! Its all okay. Its okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming the fall.)
Monica	Phoebe, yknow why dont we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Monica	Oh man!
Monica	Hes gonna eat the cake!
Monica	Im glad youre here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
Chandler	(To Ross) Monica said wedding.
Monica	Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Monica	Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Monica	Do you mind telling us what it is?
Monica	What is DOOL?
Ross	(to Monica and Rachel) Its winter, they are fewer people on the street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)
Monica	Who are they killing off?
Monica	Shes my favorite character on DOOL.
Monica	And the way she slaps all the time!
Monica	Wouldnt you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards Chandler.)
Monica	What is that?
Monica	It sounds like its coming from across the street.
Monica	What?
Monica	Nooo!!
Monica	No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Monica	He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! Its not even a song!
Monica	Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
Monica	No! No-no theyre not. Theyre still very angry! But yknow Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Monica	(interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Rachel	(screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monicas.)
Monica	(entering with Rachel) Oh my God! Its true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Monica	Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to her cheek.)
Monica	(breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To Cecilia) Umm, youre a stupid bitch.
Cecilia	I really cant slap you. (Monica walks away angrily)
Monica	Nice to meet you! My God youre great!
Rachel	What-what about Monica?
Monica	What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Monica	Come on! It wasnt that bad!
Monica	All right, what about the third guy?
Monica	Can you blame him?
Monica	Well then we still have a problem.
Monica	Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies. (Points to her chest.)
Monica	Phoebe, were getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Monica	Are you serious?
Chandler	No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Monica	Were never gonna find anybody.
Monica	Joey look its really sweet
Joey	No-no-no-no look no! I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts! Yknow? Everyone knows Im an ass man!
Monica	That is true.
Chandler	(To Monica) Yknow, we havent found anybody else.
Monica	It might be kinda cool.
Monica	Hey Pheebs, hows it going?
Monica	Oh, Im sorry. Can I get you something?
Monica	Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)
Monica	Its Hexadrin.
Monica	Okay, while were waiting for these pills to kick in, Im gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some nice soft pillows under your head, Im gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And ImSit down(She sits down on the couch)gonna make you some tea. And then, Im gonna rub your feet.
Joey	Oh! My head! Oh! (Hes sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!
Monica	Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)
Monica	No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Monica	Yknow, the possible side affects.
Monica	Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Monica	In case it happens.
Monica	You did it! You got ordained?!
Monica	Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her torso.)
Monica	Yeah!
Joey	Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so (Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." (Monica and Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nods her approval.) "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Chandler	(To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
Phoebe	I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?
Monica	Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Monica	How about receiving?
Chandler	No, not us (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)
Monica	I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Monica	It doesnt say that!
Monica	There you go!
Monica	No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Rosss mom.
Monica	And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much
Monica	(standing outside) Cute PJs! Youre really livin it up here in London huh?
Monica	(entering) Is Joey here?
Monica	Wouldnt you be?
Monica	Really?
Monica	Well, not anymore.
Monica	I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Monica	Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Monica	Okay!
Monica	(breaking the kiss) Yknow whats weird?
Monica	This doesnt feel weird!
Monica	Youre a really good kisser.
Monica	Hm-hmm!
Monica	Wow! You are really fast!
Monica	Were gonna see each other naked.
Monica	Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Monica	One!
Monica	Two!
Monica	Eh, we werent that close anyway!
Chandler	Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)
Monica	Okay, can we change the topic? Because its really doing nothing for me.
Phoebe	Yeah, its totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
Monica	What?!
Monica	Okay, fine but please dont be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wantedjust sex. So, when Iwent to your room that nightI was actually lookingfor Joey. (Joey smiles.)
Chandler	(To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Monica	No because it-it didnt seem important.
Monica	Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Joey	And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv(Shuts up on Monicas glare.)
Monica	Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Joey	Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now Im a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Joey	What?! Thats not fair! Its not my fault! I was off with my brides maid! And whos to say I wouldve even said yes?! (To Monica) I mean I wouldve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Chandler	Okay, its just weird! Okay? I dont want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I needI dont know what I need. I need a walk.
Monica	Wait Chandler come on, letsits not a big deal!
Monica	Hey-hey.
Chandler	Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Monica	Yeah baby! (Phoebe and Joey nod.)
Phoebe	Im really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.
Monica	Honey! Dinners ready!
Monica	Your favorite!
Monica	Yep! And lots of it!
Monica	Okay, in we go.
Monica	So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Chandler	So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that were trying to get to play at the wedding?
Monica	Chandler.
Chandler	Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
Monica	I will.
Monica	No, Ill do it. You just stick to your job.
Joey	This is impossible Monica, why dont you just pick all 15? (Hands back the paper.)
Monica	There were only twelve.
Monica	What are peanut butter fingers?!
Phoebe	(To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Monica	This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I cant believe I found it!
Monica	Well Im Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
Monica	Have you found your dress yet?
Monica	No, I cant afford this either. No. I-I-Im, Im just to figure out which one I want then Im gonna get it at Kleinmans, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Monica	Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Megan	(To Monica) So when are you getting married?
Monica	Oh May 15th.
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	Jeffery.
Monica	The best man? Wow!
Monica	Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Monica	All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what youre looking for! (Holds up a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She passes out whistles to them.) Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Monica	All right.
Monica	(To Rachel) Hey! Dont be a baby!
Monica	No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Dont crowd me! (Finds it) This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, its perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) Im sorry, this ones taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!
Monica	Megan!
Megan	Monica!
Monica	You came?!
Monica	This is my dress!
Monica	Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
Monica	What? You freak! You wouldnt even have known about this place if it wasnt for me!
Monica	Maybe I do! Im pretty feisty! (She blows the signal.)
Phoebe	IWe gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)
Phoebe	Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachels hand and drags her towards Monica.) Excuse me! Excuse me! (Shes knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)
Monica	(handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!
Monica	NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)
Monica	Oh
Phoebe	I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)
Monica	Hello? (Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen here missy! (Listens) Wh(She is hung up on.)
Monica	That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldnt have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Monica	What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! WhChandler wants the band. What do I do?
Monica	How?
Monica	Phoebe, hes gotta be in the room for that to work.
Monica	Well umm, we were just talking about the yknow, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether yknow, they were the right way to go.
Chandler	Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And theres another reason too.
Chandler	Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Monica	Oh crap!
Monica	(from the bedroom) Dont come in here!
Monica	No! We only mess around at his place!
Monica	No, Im wearing a wedding dress.
Monica	Yeah but Im not keeping it.
Monica	Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you cant like it.
Monica	Really?
Monica	Oh because it doesntreally fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Monica	Okay! But you cant rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Monica	(entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? (They ignore her.) Guys?
Monica	All right? Whats going on?
Monica	Im sorry. Im sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone. (She heads for the bedroom.)
Joey	Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Yknow, she could use a little(Whistles that she needs to do what theyre doing.) (Something happens on the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)
Monica	Joey!
Monica	Congratulations! Wow! I cant believe youre nominated for an Emmy!
Monica	Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Monica	Honey? Is that something youre making up?
Monica	(to Joey) Okay, Ill go!
Monica	Really? (Looks.) My God, hes really cute.
Monica	Phoebe, Im engaged!
Monica	Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged. (Points to her ring.)
Monica	Well you should be embarrassed. (Leaves.)
Joey	(pretending to be an announcer) And the winner isJoey Tribbiani! (He then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a bottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didnt prepare a speech. But umm, Id like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my parents, whove always been there for me. Id also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel
Monica	Hey! Howd your date go with Jake?
Phoebe	Oh, great! We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)
Monica	Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.
Monica	And did he?
Phoebe	Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)
Monica	Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Monica	Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Monica	No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up! I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Phoebe	Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Monica	Phoebe, its okay. You dont have to tip toe around me. I-Ive been thinking about it and umm, yknow what? Im okay about not having that new relationship feeling
Monica	See? Thats what I mean. I mean that, thats great! But I wouldnt trade in what I have for that. I mean Im gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and thats what makes me happy. (Chandler approaches.) Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is dont you think?
Joey	(angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head in disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. (There is applause, which Joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest of the nominees), from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is(Opens the envelope)Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. (Applause) Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldnt be with us tonight so Ill be accepting this award on her behalf. (Realizes something) And Im sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. Shed also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel whos sittin right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone is turned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)
Monica	Have you seen Chandler?
Monica	Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that Im not gonna have and its freaking me out. I dont know what to do about it.
Phoebe	Okay, dont sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guys cute. (Points to a guy sitting behind Monica.)
Monica	Phoebe! Come on Im serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Monica	Why?
Monica	You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Monica	So Im not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy Im gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Monica	Your mother told you this?
Monica	The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Phoebe	Oh my God! Youre right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell Chandler! Hurry before its too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean putting out doesnt get you love? (Monica is shocked.)
Monica	Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Monica	Youre wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Monica	Doesnt it ever just freak you out that-that youre never gonna be with anybody new again?
Monica	Just, I love you so much. JustIts just sometimes it bothers me that Im never gonna have that feeling. Yknow when you meet someone for the first time and its new and exciting? Yknow that rush?
Monica	Okay, but all right youre a guy, does it not freak you that youre never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Monica	Even with me?
Chandler	I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Monica	Really?
Monica	Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you dont have to worry. No, besides yknow what? Im gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid
Monica	What was it for?
Joey	(to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!
Monica	Wow!
Monica	Yeah. But a part of me also cant wait til its over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Monica	Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Monica	I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Monica	Uh-hmm.
Monica	Ross, shes 25 years old.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Subtle guys!
Monica	I know youre planning my surprise bridal shower.
Monica	Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.)
Monica	Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Monica	Thats what you say about porn.
Monica	No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Monica	Plus, everyones gonna see your thing. (Giggles.)
Rachel	Ooh great! Very Monica.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Oh boy me too!
Monica	Yeah?
Monica	The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Monica	Okay. (They both jump up to head for there room, but Monica stops.) But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.
Monica	Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Monica	So, are you ready to go?
Monica	(catching him) Chandler!
Monica	(To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Monica	Because Purvry Perverson over here cant stop staring at her.
Chandler	I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. Its called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monicas eyes.) Say something.
Monica	You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Monica	She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Monica	Wafer thin ice!
Monica	So to get this part you cant be?
Monica	But you are?
Monica	But you told them you werent?
Monica	Wow! Wow! And its definitely all gone? Theres nothing there to work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?
Monica	Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning togrow a turtleneck!
Monica	Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Monica	Unless!
Monica	Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Monica	Well Im not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head Im thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Monica	(entering) Hey!
Monica	Well uh, Im trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Monica	Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that wont work. Cheese? (Picks it up) That wont work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope that wont work.
Monica	No its umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, Im gonna go guys.
Monica	I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! (Runs out.)
Rachel	(To Phoebe, after Monicas gone) We have to get her a present?!
Cassie	Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monicas place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Rachel	Well, I dont know. I called all the people in Monicas phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Rachel	(to her) Hi! Im Rachel. This is Phoebe. Im the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Woman	So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
Monica	Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Monica	Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is made of bologna. (Points.)
Monica	Oh, just until the glue dries.
Monica	(to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Monica	Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know its gonna shrink.
Monica	I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, thats really just for me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why dont you go into your room and try these on and well seeget a better idea of whats gonna work.
Monica	Toothpick?
Monica	What are you trying on now?
Monica	And?
Monica	Joey!
Monica	What?! Which one?!
Monica	Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch.) Oh.
Rachel	Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Monica	For what?
Monica	You al-you already had it?
Monica	Well no wait a minute thats not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Monica	Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk to people I dont even like!
Rachel	Monica.
Joey	Probably Monica and Chandler.
Monica	Wait a minute, she isnt Shes not the one who you
Rachel	(To Monica) Yes.
Monica	Wow!
Monica	(To Joey) They were lovers.
Monica	(telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where the band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have peoples names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachels place.)
Rachel	Oh wow. Why dont we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs. Monica just glares at her.) These pins arent for playing are they?
Monica	(To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Monica	Chandler, relax its not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a close one.
Monica	Okay, I think thats it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like theyre having fun dont they?
Monica	Oh! (Gets up) Lets see, wellif this is the wedding hall then umm (Walks away) youre parents will be at home in Queens.
Monica	Why would they think theyre invited?
Monica	Joey!
Monica	Rosss parents are my parents!
Monica	Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Monica	All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Rachel	(motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Rachel	Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!
Chandler	Oh, its not just that, I would be Englands most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?
Rachel	Huh. Does Monica know about this?
Monica	Hey. Oh good-good youre here! All right, I figured it out. Im gonna take two tables of eight, Im gonna add your parents, and Im gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Monica	(looking at him) What?!
Monica	Oh thats too bad. Its true, but too bad.
Monica	Oh Joey!
Monica	No she hasnt.
Monica	Well, what am I going to say?
Joey	I dont know. Just uh, just tell em it was a mix-up with the invitations, orNo-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I dont think you can blame it on them so (He dials the phone and hands it to Monica.)
Monica	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah Im just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent werent delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey gives her a thumbs up.)
Monica	Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Monica	What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Monica	007 has a fancy car!
Monica	007 gets all the ladies.
Monica	How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and Ill make you a nice martini.
Monica	How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Monica	Hey.
Monica	The show?!
Monica	Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Monica	The wedding starts at six.
Monica	Youll vamp?!
Monica	You just carry that around?
Monica	Between you and
Monica	A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Joey	(entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Monica	All right thats it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I dont care!
Monica	(defeated) Oh.
Monica	Do you realize that four weeks from today were getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Monica	Theres still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Monica	Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Monica	No! But I know exactly what Im going to say.
Monica	(handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Lets just do it right now. Okay? It wont be hard. Just say whats in your heart. (She goes back, sits down, and starts feverishly writing.)
Chandler	(writing) Monica, there are no words (To Joey and Ross) There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Chandler	Im so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You shouldve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Rachel	Monica what?
Monica	You have to help me! Im supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this! (Shows them what shes been working on.)
Monica	Thank you.
Monica	Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)
Phoebe	Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)
Ross	Well, why dont you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Fat Monica	Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Monica	Ennnh.
Monica	Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Monica	Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out theres more than three), five, six, and seven!
Monica	Its kind of an important one!
Monica	All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)
Joey	Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica
Chandler	(writing) Monica
Monica	No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Monica	Oh yeah? When?
Monica	Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica	Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica	What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Monica	Well?
Monica	Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
Chandler	Look, Monica
Monica	Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
Monica	I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
Monica	What?
Monica	You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Monica	Yes, you did!
Monica	You love me!
Monica	Then all your stuff would be here.
Monica	Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnt make any sense.
Monica	You wanted it to be a surprise.
Monica	Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As tofall in love with my bestmy best Theres a reason why girls dont do this!
Chandler	Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?
Monica	Yes.
Monica	Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) Were engaged!!!
Joey	How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Ross	Hows Monica coming along with her vows?
Monica	Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Chandler	Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)Diet Coke.
Joey	(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
Monica	Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Monica	Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Monica	(on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Monica	(on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
Phoebe	(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Phoebe	(screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Monica	Bye!
Monica	Actually, I did!
Monica	Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Monica	Them?! Who's them?
Monica	Joey!
Monica	Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So
Monica	She's bluffing!
Monica	You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Monica	Of course.
Chandler	Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Chandler	Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Monica	I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
Monica	Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Monica	Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Rachel	Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Monica	Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Joey	Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Monica	Hey, you guys!
Monica	Oh thats so sweet.
Monica	Yeah, I dont hear Chandlers and he doesnt hear mine.
Phoebe	(To Monica) Oh, thats beautiful.
Rachel	(To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?
Monica	Chandler!!
Chandler	I stole Monicas and changed the name.
Monica	Hey!
Rachel	Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say youre the only one whos allowed to drive it.
Monica	Yeah, well hes my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Ross	Its a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Monica	Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after youre done.
Monica	Nice work everybody! So much for the yknow, "You can drive it, but dont tell Rachel" plan!
Phoebe	Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)
Monica	Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I wont let you drive the Porsche is because youre a terrible driver. There! That wasnt about the wedding.
Rachel	Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what shes talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Monica	Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Monica	Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.
Monica	Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
Monica	So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care.
Phoebe	Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monicas. Ill be right back. (She goes to get it.)
Monica	Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)
Monica	Its your suitcase. Were going to Las Vegas.
Chandler	Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money well save!! (Monica just looks at him.) Were not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Monica	Were going to Las Vegas to see your dad. Its time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Monica	No you didnt. Oh and honey just so you know, now that youre marrying me, you dont get to win anymore.
Monica	Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know
Monica	Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? Thats a, thats a pretty great dad.
Monica	Whos Mr. Girabaldi?
Monica	Chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe its time that you let that stuff go. If your fathers not at your weddingyoure gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Monica	Yes!
Monica	How much did ever really win before?
A Waiter in Drag	(to Chandler and Monica) Has someone taken your order yet?
Monica	Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. (To Chandler) She? (To the waiter) Im-Im sorry Im new. I dont
Monica	I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Monica	Why not?!
Monica	What?!
Monica	That cant be your father.
Monica	What?
Monica	Relax! Youll be fine. (Chandler exhales and turns off the table light.) Oh much better. Youre invisible now.
Monica	Can we have our drinks please?! WaiterUh, tress!
Helena	(To Monica) And who is your friend?
Monica	Im-Im Monica.
Helena	Monica! Where are you from?
Monica	New York.
Helena	Im not very fond of New York. Queens I like. (Noticing Monicas ring.) Ooh, what is this sparkle something! (Shows the audience who woos.) Honey! Huh?
Chandler	Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Monica	(looks at Chandler) Inin two weeks.
Helena	We? (Looks at Monica who nods.)
Monica	(To Chandler) You okay?
Chandler	(To Monica) When I was growing up Iplayed the one on the far left.
Monica	Do you realize this is probably the last time well all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Phoebe	Why?! Whats happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.) Oh! (Realizes.)
Monica	Old?
Monica	Thats much better.
Monica	Were gonna pick up the wedding dress then were gonna have lunch with mom. (Joey stands up.)
Ross	No, itsIts not that. Umm, now what Im going to say to you, Im not saying as your friend. Okay? Im-Im saying as it as Monicas older brother.
Ross	Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldnt be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monicas older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! (Chandler laughs.) What? Im-Im-Im serious! (Chandler laughs harder.) ComeHey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? Im-Im not kidding here!
Chandler	Okay. (Pause) You wont believe what Monicas older brother just said to me!
Monica	Im making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Monica	Well, so far I have uh, my brides maids dresses wont get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I dont have my something blue.
Monica	I had to go with the odds Rach.
Monica	That other play?
Monica	Wait! Wait! Wait! You cant start today! Todays the rehearsal dinner!
Monica	Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Monica	Who did we fight in World War I?
Monica	Honey, we gotta go!
Monica	(laughs) I dont have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Monica	Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow well be getting married?
Monica	I just, I cant believe that we made it!
Monica	Im sorry butnothing.
Monica	Wellhonestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Monica	Really?
Monica	Ohh, Im so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean its really, its made me stay calm. (Chandler just looks at her.) I coulda been worse!
Monica	(voice on answering machine) Hi! If youre calling before Saturday, youve reached Monica and Chandler. But if youre calling after Saturday, youve reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Monica	Hey Maureen! (They hug.) Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
Ross	(walks up) Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
Monica	What is that?
Monica	Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
Monica	Dad! Theres Ross (points), why dont you go talk to him?
Monica	Hi Mr.Bing.
Monica	It-its so great to see you both here.
Chandler	Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)
Monica	Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandlers dad and try to keep him away from Chandlers mom?
Monica	He is the man in the black dress.
Rachel	Man in the black dress (Monica walks away and Rachel looks around to find a woman in a black dress.) (To her) Hi! Im Rachel! Im a friend of Monica and Chandlers!
Monica	All right, Im gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Monica	Who wants it? Anybody?
Monica	Nobody wants to do it? All right, Ill do it myself.
Rachel	Monica! Im not gonna screw it up!
Monica	Yknow what? Youre right, Im sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Monica	Okay. Sorry. (Monica goes into the bathroom.)
Ross	Is uh, is Monica here?
Rachel	(reading the note) Tell Monica Im sorry.
Phoebe	(walking up) Whats up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads it.) Tell Monica Im sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!
Rachel	Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk.
Phoebe	Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry.
Ross	LookOkay, Im just gonnaIm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Monica	(entering from her room, excitedly) Im getting married today!!! (She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I dont care because todays my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)
Monica	(re-entering) Im gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her room.)
Phoebe	Yeah, but youve got to pull yourself together! Monica cant see you like this! Then shell know somethings wrong!
Phoebe	Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, thats gone too. This is Monicas bathroom right?!
Phoebe	There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. Monicas pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she wont be totally alone.
Phoebe	I know! Monicas gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Monica	Hey! Okay, so I thought wed start with my make up and then do my hair.
Monica	About what?
Monica	Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Rachel	No Monica! Im serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Monica	Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Monica	(jumping up) Rachel! You okay?
Chandler	Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that Im related to Monica. How is she?
Monica	(interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel Im sorry! I have to start getting ready! Im getting married today!
Monica	(getting up) Im gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour! (Starts for the bathroom.)
Monica	What?!
Monica	I cant go to lunch!!
Monica	(entering) Whats going on?
Monica	Okay, youre-youre really freaking me out.
Monica	How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Monica	Oh wow! Okay. Dont scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
Phoebe	Oh my God Monica!
Monica	I wanna wear this everyday.
Monica	(starting to cry) Im so happy for me.
Phoebe	Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because, they frown on that.
Rachel	Yeah! Yeah. Theyretheyre-theyre my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Ross	Oh my God! Monica!
Monica	I know! Hey, hows Chandler doin?
Monica	Are you okay?
Monica	Well, youre-youre sweating.
Monica	Oh thats sweet. Dont touch me.
Chandler	I know about Monica.
Chandler	Monicas pregnant.
Chandler	But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so shed know I was okay.
Monica	Shes right there.
Mrs. Geller	Not that old crow, my mother. (They stop and she kisses Monica on the cheek.) Congratulations darling.
Monica	Not now.
Monica	(To Chandler) Who is this?
Chandler	(in Monicas ear) Hes Greek Orthodox.
Joey	(entering) Thats my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, Im sorry Im a little late. You may be confused by this now, (Hes still in costume) but you wont be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, lets get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. Ive known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as Ive left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Monica	(To Rachel) He took off?
Monica	Chandler, for so long II wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that Id ever been looking for my whole life. And nowhere we arewith our future before usand I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you dont want to. You go!
Chandler	(To Ross) No, thats okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way its okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if Im sure? (He leans in and kisses her.)
Monica	I do.
Chandler	(To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.
Monica	What baby?
Monica	We have a baby?
Monica	I didnt take a pregnancy test.
Transcribers Note	This is stuff we never saw from all of the seasons, so for all of the scene settings I will be using the current arrangements. Even though some of the out takes take place when Chandler was living with Joey and Rachel was living with Monica, when Joey and Chandler were living in Monica and Rachels, and the current arrangements.
Monica	(holding her hand in front of her face) When you were little you slept through-through the Grand Canyon.
Monica	(the hands still there) When-when you were little you slept through the Grand Canyon. (She actually itches her nose this time.)
Monica	When you were little you slept through the Grand(Pointing again)Oh fffff.
Monica	Sorry, lets go back! Cause youve got more to say.
Chandler	Hey Rach! (She breaks up and goes back into Monicas.)
Monica	It was so wild! We told em we were the Gundersons in 16
Monica	What are you doing?!
Monica	Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!
Monica	Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Phoebe	Well at Monicas you can eat(Suddenly cracks up.)
Joey	Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross. (Ross lies on the floor.) Ill be Monica. Go! (He jumps down and cuddles up with Ross.)
Matt	And then sometimes during the show yknow but youre like, the scenes going one way but youre just tempted to say something another time. Like, do you remember that one where Monicas baking cookies in our old apartment?
Monica	Are you saying that you dont want to get with this?
Phoebe	(spitting the cookie out onto a napkin) Oh, sweet Je(Beep)sus! Oh! Monica, these are the (laughing) cookies they serve in hell!
Monica	Joey?
Chandler	Monicas gotta have the phone in the right place and(Frantic babbling.)
Monica	Oh what are doing?!
Monica	I think you got it!
Monica	Okay.
Ross	(To Monica) Okay, I know Im not supposed to know, but I do. And Im so excited for you!
Ross	Monicas pregnant!
Monica	Guys! Im not pregnant.
Monica	You didnt tell anybody I was did you?!
Photographer	Now why dont we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.
Monica	(To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
Monica	Find some! Please! Anything that doesnt say I-I died tragically in France. (Joey leaves to find clothes.)
Phoebe	Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you werent pregnant?
Monica	Because Im not.
Monica	What are you talking about?
Monica	Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	Why?!
Monica	Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Photographer	Why dont we have Monica step away and well get Chandler and the bridemaids.
Phoebe	So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Monica	Honey, Im going to put my hand in your pocket!
Monica	No.
Monica	What?!
Monica	Oh that is so sweet!
Monica	Yes.
Monica	Whats the matter?
Monica	Well, are you going to be able to do this?
Monica	Well, the good news is, I dont think anyones looking at us.
Monica	(seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.
Monica	Honey, Im not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)
Ross	Hi. Im uh, Im Ross. I dont, I dont believe weve met. Im Monicas older brother.
Monica	Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
Monica	This is so huge.
Monica	Of course not nothing is. Between me and you
Monica	in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Monica	How?
Monica	Well I-I talked to and uh, shes definitely going to have this baby. Yknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
Monica	Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard its gonna be.
Monica	Well, theres a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize shes not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
Monica	Are you okay?
Rachel	Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesnt work.) Oh thats-thats actually how the French drink it.
Monica	Oh really?!
Monica	(interrupting) Rachels really the one whos pregnant.
Monica	How do you feel?
Monica	Yes! Maybe its a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
Monica	You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Oh, wait a minute! Whos is the father?!
Monica	Oh, come on its my wedding! That can be my present.
Joey	(clinks his glass) Id like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) Im sorry. And-and some scared memoriesWhoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized Ill always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!
Monica	Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
Monica	Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)
Monica	Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesnt matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.
Monica	(entering) Did I miss it? (Phoebe nods no.) Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if its positive, were gonna
Monica	Go ahead Rach.
Monica	Well Well, great.
Monica	Oh God
Monica	Are you really gonna do this?
Monica	(depressed) Thats right. Im no longer a bride. Ill never be a bride again. Now, Im just someones wife!
Chandler	And Im the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey, come on dont be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
Monica	Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)
Monica	Thats not til Thursday.
Monica	They wont be ready for weeks.
Monica	Thats true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Front Desk Clerk	(To Monica) Heres a copy of your bill.
Monica	Oh thanks. (Reading the bill) Champagne, strawberriesOh my God! I cant believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
Chandler	So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	No! (Pause) But, theyre callin out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldnt mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
Monica	A tiny salt shaker!!!
Monica	Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
Monica	Good. Okay, Im just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
Monica	Whew. Although yknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean I guess yknow it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
Monica	Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)
Monica	Hey, how are you feelin? Any morning sickness?
Monica	No! Joey and Ross dont know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebes pregnant.
Phoebe	Yeah thats right Chandler does still think Im pregnant. He hasnt asked me how Im feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.
Monica	Wow. Yknow it is so weird. I mean, youre gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea whats gonna happen.
Monica	What was that bam?
Monica	Whos David Lynn?
Chandler	Well this is great. Yknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, shes really depressed.
Chandler	I dont know, Monica picked out the flowers.
Monica	No! No! I shouldnt have even opened these! I mean IJoey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
Monica	Give me one more.
Monica	Oh my God! Joey!
Monica	You cant marry him!
Monica	Phoebe!
Monica	Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one whos pregnant.
Monica	Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in nine months!
Monica	Theres a dude?
Phoebe	(gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is (She walks into Monica and Chandlers.)
Monica	People have got to finish their stories!
Monica	(throwing up the last present) I dont know how any of these got opened?!
Monica	I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
Monica	Yeah. What is that?
Monica	Hey! Howd it go?
Monica	So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
Monica	What?!
Monica	Great! Were hangin in the kitchen! (She drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Lets stay in the kitchen!
Monica	Wow! That is a great picture!
Monica	Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)
Monica	That would be a good idea.
Monica	You kissed another woman!
Monica	Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)
Monica	Yeah I am!
Monica	Thats right. Get it out of your system while were alone.
Monica	Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldnt find though was your Speedo.
Monica	Hey!
Rachel	I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (Hugs Monica.)
Monica	Thank you.
Monica	This is so great! And Im gonna be your babys aunt!
Monica	Yeah, but Im the only one related by blood.
Monica	Well, what were you gonna say?
Monica	Hey! Good luck!
Monica	Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
Monica	I didnt think you could keep it a secret.
Joey	Yknow, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
Phoebe	You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monicas guest towels?
Joey	Monicas chicken parm! Ill take care of it. (He picks up the phone) Hey Mr. Treeger, its Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandlers apartment. Its an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. (Hangs up.)
Monica	Theyre kissing lets just go around them.
Monica	Im in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
Monica	(to the couple) Hi! Can you do that and walk? Cause she said, "Next."
Monica	(To Chandler) Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Lets act like were on our honeymoon.
Monica	Grab my ass!
Monica	Hi, sorry. I almost didnt hear you, because yknow Im just so in love with my new husband. Were on our honeymoon.
Monica	Oh no, you see were on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
Monica	You see, if wed gone around them like I said, weShe wouldve given us those tickets. Damnit!
Monica	Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
Monica	Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler in tow.)
Monica	Oh my God! Oranges!
Monica	Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before she exits.) Go! Go! Go!
Phoebe	Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? Cause yknow umm, they dont-they dont have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
Monica	I cant believe were here.
Monica	What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)
Monica	No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Monica	Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean youre not the only ones on your honeymoon!
Chandler	(looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.
Joey	Hey Monica its Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin from your apartment.
Monica	What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!
Monica	Well do something! Get in there!
Monica	Yeah! Do that!
Monica	No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I dont hear anything! Come on!
Ross	I grew up with Monica! If you didnt eat fast you didnt eat!!
Monica	Youre really sticking with the shell necklace huh? (Points to necklace of shells hes wearing.)
Monica	Hi sweetie!
Monica	Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.
Monica	No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
Monica	Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
Monica	I know.
Monica	This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
Phoebe	Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! (Angrily) Hi Greg, Im Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
Monica	We didnt get anything for anyone.
Monica	That you can have.
Monica	It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean youre having a baby!
Monica	Oh great! (Shows them the picture.)
Monica	All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us yknow how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
Phoebe	Monica! Thats not right! Start with where.
Monica	Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em.
Monica	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street deli?
Monica	(on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)
Monica	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) (To All) Its the deli again!
Monica	(hangs up) I dont think this numbers right!
Monica	What?! People dont do that!
Monica	They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
Monica	And youve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
Monica	Yeah, definitely.
Monica	I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
Monica	Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out fake names.
Monica	I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
Monica	(rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)
Monica	What about my questions?
Monica	Oh, Im sorry. Was that another joke?
Monica	Hell yeah!!!
Rachel	(on tape) I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I
Monica	(taking Rachels hand) Sweetie okay. Its okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. Im fine.
Monica	I know.
Rachel	(on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica) "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" (She tilts her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Ohoh-oh-oh
Monica	You used the Europe story!
Monica	(on phone) Hello Greg? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5 (Listens) (To Chandler) That is their old number! Jennys been giving it out since they moved!
Monica	(on phone) Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday? (Listens) Okay, how about Sunday? (Listens) Okay umm, the week after that? (Listens) The week after that? (Listens) Yknow what Greg? Yknow what? We are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious Jenny cant see that then (Listens) January 15th? (Chandler dances.) Well see you then! (Listens) Okay!
Monica	Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! (Phoebe enters) Hey Phoebe!
Monica	Hey how was dinner?!
Monica	Okay!
Monica	Okay!
Phoebe	(To Monica) I didnt see this on the menu.
Monica	Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.
Phoebe	Oh, so you're Monicas boss?
Monica	Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?
Monica	All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
Monica	All right, all right! Lets just cut to the chase, okay? (To Phoebe) Youre single. (To Tim) Youre single. (To Phoebe) He gets off work at eleven. (To Tim) Shell be waiting for your call. (To Phoebe) Ill give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! (Everyone in the kitchen stops.) I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
Phoebe	Ooh Monica!
Monica	Hi!
Monica	II have to fire him.
Monica	Because hes terrible! Okay, hes slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Monica	Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
Phoebe	But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
Monica	(thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
Monica	I paid to have this done.
Monica	Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
Monica	No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Monica	Why not?!
Monica	What?! You said he was sweet!
Monica	Just dont pick up your phone.
Monica	What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?
Monica	Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
Monica	Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!
Monica	What do you mean?
Monica	I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
Tim	Whoops. Sorry. (Looking at it, like a newscaster) This just in. (Phoebe fake laughs.) Oh, its 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away. (Starts to leave.)
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
Monica	Oh my pleasure. Okay, Im afraid Ive got some bad news. (Phoebe enters.) Phoebe!
Phoebe	Monica!
Monica	(simultaneously) Youre fired!
Monica	Youre fired.
Monica	Yeah and-and Im sorry too. But, well I justI like things done a certain way and the chemistrys just not right.
Tim	Wow! Umm, okay. Umm (To Phoebe) I-I-I realize I came on a little strong but, its only because I think youre so amazing. (To Monica) And uh, I-I just wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here because Iyoure the most talented chef Ive ever worked for. Anyway (Starts to leave and Phoebe and Monica trade looks.)
Monica	Tim wait!
Monica	Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-theres a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Okay.
Phoebe	And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves, which disgusts Monica.)
Monica	Hey you guys?
Monica	I know its last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
Monica	And everybody has to wear costumes. (And theres general disconcertment.) Come on! Itll be fun!
Monica	You have to!
Monica	So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
Monica	Wait! Youre supposed to wear a costume!
Monica	Oh.
Monica	Im Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when youre too big for it.
Rachel	Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe, dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)
Monica	So we do Supergirl.
Chandler	(entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume
Rachel	(To Monica) Oh, you did this to him?
Monica	What?! I thought hed love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
Monica	Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
Monica	You didnt dress up either?!
Rachel	Ohh Oh, honey here. Take it all. (Pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) Monica! We need more candy?
Monica	What?! Theres only been like four kids.
Monica	What are you supposed to be?
Monica	No, space doody!
Monica	Hey Joey?
Monica	You read comic books right?
Monica	Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
Monica	Yeah
Monica	What?! Really?!
Monica	No youre fine. (Joey checks anyway.) All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?
Monica	What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard as you can!
Monica	Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, yknow, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
Monica	Oh my God, Phoebe!
Monica	Youre getting a crush on your sisters fiance.
Joey	(To Monica) Here comes the temper.
Monica	I cant answer that! Chandlers my husband.
Monica	Yeah.
Joey	(To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
Joey	Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
Chandler	(To Monica) You picked Ross?!
Monica	Ross is really strong! Okay, hes the strongest out of all three of you! (Joey looks at her.) Except for Joey.
Monica	Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, no ones gonna fight in this apartment.
Joey	Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to see a fight, lets give em what they came for!
Monica	(To Chandler) Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay? Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me. Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity! Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
Monica	(To Phoebe) Oh God!
Monica	Chandlers making his sex face.
Monica	Look, I wanted to tell Im-Im sorry you lost.
Monica	(laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.
Monica	Chandler please!
Monica	Lets go big bunny!
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
Monica	Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
Monica	Well then who?
Monica	(shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then
Monica	Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Monica	Did she really say that?
Monica	Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.
Monica	Well, usually when Im this anxious, I clean!
Monica	Oh well umm, I make it myself! Its two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient isyknow what? We just met.
Monica	(To Chandler) I love her.
Monica	Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)
Monica	She stole my jeans!
Monica	I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
Monica	Dont you see? Its the perfect crime!
Monica	I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
Monica	I guess.
Monica	Fine. Im just glad I didnt give her my secret ingredient.
Monica	Yeah! (Laughs.)
Monica	Nice jeans!
Monica	Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) Youre not gettin it.
Monica	Oh, I fell asleep.
Monica	Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? Thatll really work up your appetite for lunch.
Monica	Hello.
Monica	Im sorry. Ive never had a maid before, is this not okay?
Monica	Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
Monica	Because I put my head between her legs.
Monica	Theyre my pants!
Monica	No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Monica	Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) Shes wearing my bra!
Monica	My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
Monica	Heres the plan! Okay? Im going to leave you get a look at Brendas bra!
Monica	I would do it but she thinks Im attracted to her!
Monica	Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on were a team! Were in this together!
Monica	Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at womans breasts all the time!
Monica	Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a womans breasts.)
Monica	Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, youll know its mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, theres a very noticeable rip.
Monica	(looking at Rachels jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!
Monica	No I didnt!
Monica	Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
Monica	The pink one with the flowers?!
Rachel	You mean the one that youre wearing? (Adjusts Monicas pink bra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)
Monica	Sounds about right.
Monica	(recognizing him and panicking) No you dont!
Phoebe	Oh my God!!! Monica!! Hes the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
Monica	Im sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
Monica	Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
Monica	(entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight youre gonna have a bachelor party.
Monica	Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
Monica	Come on! Come on, itll be fun! Itll make me feel so much better.
Monica	So dont think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as aa two month anniversary present.
Monica	Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
Monica	Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
Joey	Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.
Monica	Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girls number.
Monica	My husband.
Monica	Shes a stripper.
Monica	Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
Monica	Oh my God Stu! I-I cant believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker?
Monica	(entering quickly) Shes a hooker! Shes a hooker! Shes a (Stops as she sees her.) Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. (Goes and shakes the hookers hand.)
Monica	I swear I didnt know she was a hooker! I mean whDid you let her smoke in here?
Monica	Yknow what? Im gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper (turns on the radio), and youre gonna get a stripper. (She starts to strip.)
Chandler	Monica! Wait!
Monica	What?
Monica	Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think Ill take them off. (Goes to do so.)
Monica	Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen knocking something down, but she continues to strip.)
Monica	(entering) Oh good youre all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four oclock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
Monica	He was in Rosss classmarching bandkinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
Monica	No that was Jarred! Wow! I havent thought about him in a long time (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm Wills, Wills here on business and he didnt have a place to go so I invited him here.
Monica	Oh, and by the way, hes lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I still love Chandler.
Monica	All right okay, just so you know, Im not gonna make a turkey this year.
Monica	Well Phoebe doesnt eat turkey
Monica	All right! Okay, its just Phoebe. Wills still on a diet, Chandler doesnt eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachels having her aversion to poultry.
Monica	Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
Monica	All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
Monica	All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
Monica	Hey, isnt weird to think about how next year at this time theyll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing him) Rachels! But good to know where youre at!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	You too!
Monica	Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but hes really into the game so I dont want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)
Monica	Im gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Monica	No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! Were not at a barn dance. Youve gottayou wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?
Phoebe	Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To Chandler) So hows the game?
Phoebe	I dont believe you! That isbrilliant! And Monica has no idea?
Monica	Is your team winning hon?
Monica	Oh, I didnt know you liked football.
Monica	You like Green Bay?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Aww thanks! God Will Im so glad that you came! You look great! You mustve lost like
Monica	A pie! (Will brought a pie.)
Monica	You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
Monica	This is Phoebe.
Monica	(to Will) Wanna give me a hand?
Will	Sure! Monica, I cant get over how great you look! You look stunning!
Monica	Well you look incredible too! Youre justyoure so fit!
Monica	Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
Monica	Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)
Monica	Is there a problem?
Monica	What?
Monica	Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, youve got almost an entire turkey to eat.
Monica	All right.
Joey	(To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?
Monica	Will! From high school.
Monica	(to Will) Joey.
Monica	Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)
Rachel	(sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?
Monica	Thats Will from high school!
Monica	Okay, dinners ready!
Monica	Oh, so who won?
Monica	What?
Monica	(breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why dont you sit here? (Next to Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)
Monica	(laughs) This is Chandlers chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down a huge turkey.)
Monica	About nineteen pounds.
Joey	(To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?
Monica	(To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
Monica	Oh Will. But you-youve worked so hard
Monica	Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who starts dishing out a large helping.)
Rachel	Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
Monica	I swear I didnt. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Monica	Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Monica	You started that?!
Monica	Everyone at our school heard it!
Rachel	Monica, how come you never told me this?!
Monica	I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
Monica	Joey, you dont have to finish that.
Monica	Oh! Me too!
Monica	Thats not totally true.
Monica	Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
Monica	Its true?!!
Monica	Didnt she walk with a cane?
Monica	All right, listen youre just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
Monica	And Ross, if it werent for Rachels rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
Monica	Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
Monica	Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-youve been through so much since then. And right now youve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Cant you just let this go?
Monica	Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
Monica	Yeah, you want some?
Joey	Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.) A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the knife again.) What?! Are you afraid youre gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
Monica	Hey! So what do you think?
Chandler	New haircut? (Monica nods No.) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No) Boots? (Monica nods Yes.) Boots!
Monica	Yes! Now, theyre a little more than I normally spend on bootsor rent (Shows him the receipt.)
Monica	I know.
Monica	Im sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
Monica	Hey.
Rachel	Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Monica	Theyre mine!
Monica	Honey, Im not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but Im going to wear them all the time. Youll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
Monica	Nice try; Im keeping the boots.
Monica	Hey guys!
Rachel	Hi Monica!
Monica	Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)
Monica	See Chandler? Im getting a lot of use out of them already! Theyre very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants
Monica	(almost crying) They hurt so much!
Monica	The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Monica	I cant! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that Id wear them all the time, I just cant give them away!
Monica	I cant do that either! The soles are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
Monica	(standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!
Monica	Oh nothing Im justjust was yawning. (Mimics the groan from before and stretches.)
Monica	Honey, we dont really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Monica	I-I dont-I dont think that Im gonna wear the boots tonight.
Monica	Well yknow, Im just-Im just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
Monica	Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots dont really go with it.
Monica	Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, Ill wear the boots. In fact, Ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on.
Monica	Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ow with laughing.)
Monica	Yeah! I didnt know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
Monica	Oh no, we cant walk!
Monica	Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
Monica	I cant walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
Monica	Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! Theyre killing me! One toe at a time!
Monica	How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Monica	Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. (She starts taking them off.) AhOohOohhOhhOh GodOhhOhOhhOhhhh
Monica	(notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Monica	My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
Monica	Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
Monica	Well I dont have them either. Where are they?
Monica	Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!
Monica	Okay, Im never gonna wear them again. I just didnt get a chance to say goodbye.
Monica	Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.
Monica	(to the boots) Bye bootsWait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.)
Monica	Yes, hi.
Monica	No leg-chewing for us sir.
Monica	I can't think of anything we're doing. (Quietly) Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
Monica	Okay, Ill see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Monica	That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Monica	Why did you do that?
Monica	Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
Monica	Hey, I couldve had you if I wanted you.
Monica	You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Monica	Like asking her to move in with you?
Monica	Making her a mixed tape?
Monica	All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
Monica	That is a slap in the face.
Chandler	Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
Chandler	Because uh... we-we... we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me
Chandler	Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with that bitch.
Phoebe	Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
Monica	Hi Roger.
Monica	Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think hell have sex with you.
Monica	From the tequila factory?
Monica	Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Monica	I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
Monica	All right. (He goes to push it and it doesnt move.)
Monica	Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is likeOh my, this is like my second favorite game!
Monica	Well I-I really dont remember the name of it.
Monica	Well, you justyou put a quarter in and yknow pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
Monica	Dont feel bad for me! I won like every time!
Phoebe	No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
Monica	Okay, Im next. (Phoebe starts another game.) Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
Monica	Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
Monica	You only think its stupid because you suck at it.
Monica	No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why dont you go home and wait for the thank you card?
Monica	Okay. Phoebe thats it. Come on, get outout of the chair. Get out! (She goes to move Phoebe, but Phoebe goes limp and Monica cant move her.) Oh comePhoebe!
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Well it clearly wasnt showering or shaving.
Monica	Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
Chandler	Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he cant straighten his fingers.)
Monica	What is the matter with your hand?
Monica	Chandler, why would you do that?
Monica	You think this is clever?
Monica	Hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty.
Monica	Ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one of those from me. But Bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this cant be there.
Monica	Chandler! Hes seven; hes not stupid.
Monica	All right, look Im just gonna unplug it.
Monica	Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
Monica	All right fine. Fine, Ill do it. Ive just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
Joey	Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
Monica	Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. Its gotRight(She dies.) Well, youre just a little bitch, arent you?
Monica	Theyre all Chandler.
Monica	But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
Monica	Oh my God Phoebe, youre on fire!
Monica	Dont touch her!!
Monica	(airily) Hi.
Monica	I just had the most amazing bath.
Monica	Wait, you like them with me.
Monica	Oh, baths are so relaxing!
Monica	How dirty do you think I am? Im telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
Joey	All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but thats different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
Chandler	Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
Phoebe	Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?Scene: Monica and Chandlers, Monica comes from the bathroom as Chandler enters.]
Monica	Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
Monica	No, but someones really not going to get over that idea, are they?
Monica	I drew you a bath!
Monica	Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So its a boy bath!
Monica	I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
Monica	Absolutely. (Chandler runs into the bathroom)
Monica	Bet I know how that discussions going to go. [Cut to Chandler laying in the bathtub. "Only Time," is playing in the background.]
Monica	(entering) So?
Monica	I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
Rachel	(holding stomach) Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.Scene: Chandler and Monicas, Monica is entering.]
Monica	Hello?
Monica	You know what? I-I think Ill wait out here.
Monica	Oh. (She goes into the bathroom.) Whats wrong?
Monica	What?
Monica	Okay, lets talk about something else.
Monica	Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and
Monica	You did? What was he talking about?
Monica	(groans) That was a long night.
Monica	Okay, he was talking about rules.
Monica	Umm, and looking at people differently.
Monica	What did he tell you?
Monica	Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
Monica	Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
Monica	And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
Monica	Just a minute! (To Chandler) Thats Mrs. Tribbiani!
Monica	Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
Monica	You just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)
Chandler	Oh, God! (Monica runs out to Phoebe, who is in the kitchen)
Phoebe	Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
Monica	Oh, you had that?
Monica	I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
Phoebe	Oh, just as well, I broke this one. (Monica starts smiling)
Monica	Nothing.
Monica	I mean, I-I, I really shouldnt say. I mean, Im really not supposed to.
Monica	Its a humdinger!
Monica	Somebody likes you!
Monica	No!
Monica	Its Joey!
Monica	Is it something youd be interested in?
Monica	I guess that makes sense. So, you think youre going to talk to him?
Monica	Not Chandler, just Joey.
Phoebe	Yes, and Im sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but thats very rare.
Rachel	Yes, please.Scene: Monica and Chandlers, Chandler enters as Monica comes from the bathroom.]
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Yeah, Im going to take a bath. Im just going to get a magazine.
Chandler	Okay. (As soon as Monica leaves the room, Chandler takes off his jacket and runs to the bathroom. Monica enters the bathroom to find Chandler in the bathtub.)
Monica	What do you think youre doing?
Monica	I know that youre new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
Monica	Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now youre just a girl in a tub! (Phoebe enters the bathroom)
Chandler	(To Monica) You told her?!
Monica	What?
Monica	(Pause) I dont think Id care.
Monica	Oh my God! A friend hes looking at differently, but its wrong. Its Rachel!
Phoebe	(checking for herself) (To Monica) Mazel tov.
Monica	Honey, cover it up with the boat!
Monica	It sure is nice to do this together, isnt it?
Monica	Im not touching you.
Monica	Its the salts.
Monica	(To herself) Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy! End
Monica	(opens the door wearing a robe, but leaves the chain on) Hey, whats up?
Monica	Oh, okay. No problem.
Phoebe	Okay. (Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Here you go.
Monica	Okay.
Phoebe	Great! Umm(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.)
Monica	What?!
Monica	Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
Monica	Yes! Exactly.
Monica	(laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)
Monica	Phoebe, I can explain!
Monica	Well umm, Alexandra has been
Monica	Phoebe, dont get upset!
Monica	Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they dont like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)
Monica	No, it doesnt say where it came from. Where would we return it?
Monica	Why dont we just find a place for it?
Monica	No! Thats where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
Monica	Oh, okay. Here, why dont you let me do it?
Monica	No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Monica	Feminine stuff.
Monica	Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-youll let it go.
Monica	Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)
Phoebe	(entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!
Chandler	Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said, "If it helps!" (Goes to the bedroom.)
Monica	Well itsI mean Id justId be self-conscious. Youre my friend; Id be naked.
Phoebe	Monica! We lived together for years! Ive seen you naked!
Monica	Thats different, we were roommates! And when?!
Monica	Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
Monica	Okay, if it means that much to you
Monica	Dinosaurs.
Monica	Yes.
Monica	Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Monica	No. Ooohh
Monica	(in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
Monica	Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh thats it! Thats it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh (Covers both ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)
Joey	Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Chandler	Monica has a secret closet and she wont let me see whats in it.
Chandler	Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Chandler	Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Joey	Sure. "Monica."
Monica	Hey.
Monica	I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
Monica	So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
Monica	Okay.
Monica	What?
Monica	Whats going on?
Monica	What? (Laughs.)
Monica	What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!
Monica	Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get massaged again!
Monica	Really?!
Monica	Are you sure?
Monica	I guess.
Monica	(entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!
Monica	Oh no! You werent supposed to see this!
Monica	No Chandler, you dont understand! (Chandler starts singing the theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? Im yknowIm sick.
Monica	Really? You promise you wont tell anyone?
Monica	Wellits just ummIm afraid you might mess it up.
Monica	Ohhh.
Monica	Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
Monica	Oh God!
Monica	Oh yeah right there!
Monica	Uh Phoebe?
Monica	(entering with something behind her back) Phoebe, cmere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
Phoebe	Oh, Monica, grow up!
Monica	Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebes opinion on for Valentines Day.
Monica	Not really.
Monica	All right, big brother. (holds up two ermrevealing articles of clothing) Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
Joey	Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! (the dog sticks his head between Joeys legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun.Scene: Monica and Chandlers. Chandler enters with a bouquet of roses.]
Monica	(from her bedroom) Okay! Ill be right out. Im slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
Chandler	(picking up a video from the table) Candy and Cookie. Candy and Cookie? Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some "porn") (A woman on TV breaths hard)
Joey	(to the dog) Cmere. Hey. Cmere. Thats Rachel. Shes the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with youwe love her. But we cant have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? Youre a guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be.Scene: Monica and Chandlers. Chandler is sitting on the couch staring at the tape on the coffee table with his eyes huge and his mouth wide open.]
Monica	(entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit) (Chandler glances up at Monica with his mouth still wide open and his eyes still huge)
Monica	(to herself) Ive still got it!
Monica	What is it?
Monica	Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebes. Why were you even watching it?
Monica	Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentines Day (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, its about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) Oh, wait a minute. Those arent stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?
Monica	Honey, whats going on?
Monica	Mm-hmm.
Monica	Chandler, we cant let this tape wreck Valentines Day!
Monica	Child-birth, its a natural thing! Its beautiful.
Monica	Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
Monica	Dont touch me!Scene: Central Perk. Ross is sitting on the couch reading a magazine as Mona enters.
Ross	(handing Mona the present) Happy Valentines Day! Or something to remember me by.Scene: Monica and Chandlers. Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch still staring at the screen.
Monica	How long has it been this time?
Monica	Thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about itexcept all I did was think about it.
Monica	Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
Monica	Okay. (Chandler takes the tape and sticks it under the chair cushion)
Chandler	Okay. Now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair. (Chandler crawls over to Monica and they move in to kiss, but they cant do it and back up. They move in to kiss again, and kiss very awkwardly for a second, until someone knocks on the door.)
Monica	Oh, thank God!
Monica	Come in!
Monica	Oh, my God.
Chandler	Poor Ross. (Monica and Chandler both look at each other and run over to the window to watch the action in Ross apartment)
Monica	Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? Its here.
Monica	No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
Monica	Shes rightof course not. Honey, get the tape.
Monica	Itsstill beautiful.
Monica	I know! I know, Im so sorry for you!
Rachel	Oh, my God! (Monica and Rachel both cover their eyes)
Monica	Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
Monica	OhRach!
Phoebe	Well last night, I met Monicas.
Chandler	Come on, dont be crazy. (To Rachel) You dont think theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)
Monica	Hey.
Monica	I just talked to Joey, I justI want to see how you were.
Monica	All right, I know youre hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but dont say that again.
Monica	Honey, I dont think thats something we need to worry about! First of all hes-hes never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how shed react.
Monica	Joeyhes not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Monica	No! All hes thinking about is how youre taking this! I mean, listen its totally freaking him out. Hes talking about moving to Vermont.
Monica	He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.
Monica	Honey I cant even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I dont want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that youre still his friend.
Monica	All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
Monica	Hi!
Phoebe	Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Don	Oh, hello. (Shakes Chandlers hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monicas hand.)
Monica	So, what have you guys been doing?
Monica	I know! What is this, 1985?!
Monica	Not really.
Monica	So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Monica	Oh my God! Thats my restaurant, Im the chef there.
Monica	No!
Monica	Oh, Id like a latte. Oh yknow what? If youre gonna talk about me, Im gonna go with you.
Monica	(returning) Phoebe, good work.
Monica	Yeah! Oh hes great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at Phoebe.)
Monica	Me too! Yeah, Chandler cant stand it. He wont even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
Monica	You know what Id love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheeseNot even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, Im really not high, its just I used to be fat.
Monica	Id move in tomorrow!
Monica	Id like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldnt that be nice?
Monica	Are you okay? Youve been acting weird all afternoon.
Monica	Jeez! What is with you?
Monica	All right, whats going on?
Monica	Chandler, you dont believe in soul mates?
Monica	I dont believe in soul mates either.
Monica	No. I dont think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
Monica	No, Ive had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
Monica	I know.
Chandler	Yknow what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesnt look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.
Monica	Joey, you have to talk to her!
Monica	Hey Rachel!
Chandler	I dont see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?
Monica	I dont see him. Hey! Maybe hes in the sugar bowl! (Opens the sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)
Monica	Whats up?
Monica	We were playing a game.
Monica	Sure.
Monica	(To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?
Monica	Honey, you gotta talk to her.
Monica	Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when theyre hungry.
Monica	This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know its weird, its awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Monica	Okay, Im done. Read mine.
Monica	(stunned) I-Im the head chef. I-I cant get promoted.
Monica	You mean your pink shirt?
Monica	No, I-I havent seen your pink shirt.
Monica	Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
Monica	Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
Monica	Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
Monica	Where is the James Taylor CD?
Monica	Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, were just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
Monica	Hmm, I dont know. We really have to talk this through.
Monica	Okay, I-Im sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
Monica	Yeah, like I dont know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
Monica	Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
Chandler	They were just giving those away at the store (off Monicas look) in exchange for money.
Monica	Uh I really dont know what to tell you Rach, I really dont. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
Monica	Yeah Joey shesRachels got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Yknow what, if were gonna make dinner were gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)
Monica	Honey, both yours.
Monica	Yeah? The work problem?
Monica	You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
Rachel	Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)
Monica	Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Monica	Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
Monica	What?!
Monica	Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
Monica	Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. Im-Im gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)
Monica	(to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	(To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
Monica	Yeah, Id really like to.
Monica	Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and its always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year Im going to make them cry.
Monica	No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what theyll say this year? "God, you"
Monica	Really you can do that?
Monica	Oh Im working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)
Monica	Its a dead dog. Thats Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
Monica	The good stuff, huh?
Monica	You got a present for my parents. Thats so sweet.
Ross	(picking up Chi-Chis picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Yknow Monica couldnt get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
Monica	What?!
Parker	No, no, no wait! Dont tell me. Let me guess. (Points as he says their names) Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, Im sorry Phoebe didnt mention you. (Chandler makes a face) Chandler, Im kidding all ready youre my favorite!
Monica	Thats my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Monica	Its out on the island. Its in Massapequa.
Monica	Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents?
Monica	And Ive got the car keys.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
Monica	Its just that, its so much.
Monica	I feel terrible.
Monica	Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit em. I cant wait. Theyre going to be crying so hard. Theyre going to be fighting for breath.
Monica	Okay its time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year Im going to do it.
Monica	No, no its going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably dont say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) When I look around this room, Im-Im saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she cant because shes dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember shes dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didnt see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits for people to cry, but doesnt get any tears.) You people are made of stone! Heres to mom and dad! Whatever!
Mrs. Geller	Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasnt it interesting, Jack?
Ross	Oh, no, Mom, its just Monica this year.
Monica	Okay thats it. I give up. At mom and dads 40th anniversary, youre the one giving the speech.
Monica	Oh, come on.
Monica	(starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	How cool is this?! We know three down! Im touching three down! (She has her hand on his shoulder.)
Monica	Three down knows Im married, whats three down doin?
Monica	(To Chandler) You think were being obvious?
Monica	Joey! Youre doing great!
Monica	Bye. (They resume their previous positions.)
Rachel	And you know Monica and Ross!
Monica	You slept with her didnt you?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
Monica	Oh my God, your mother!
Monica	Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
Monica	Well it wasnt my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
Monica	(interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!
Monica	Okay, yknow what? Dont worry, okay? Well take care of it. Well call her. Just go home and get ready.
Monica	Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs. Green.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If youre in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call herHello Mrs. Green! Hi, its Monica Geller.
Mrs. Green	Oh, hello Monica.
Monica	(on phone) Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but weve decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
Monica	Yeah, Im sorry. Im-Im so sorry.
Monica	(To Phoebe) Oh my God, my ass is sweating! (on phone) Please! Please! Can you come? Its today at four.
Monica	Thank you. (Hangs up.)
Monica	Son of a bitch! (Calls Mrs. Green again.)
Monica	You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Monica	Hi!
Monica	Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Monica	Shes still mad.
Monica	Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
Monica	Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.
Monica	What?
Monica	I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Monica	Thats right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you dont want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Monica	(To Phoebe) This is great! Now shes gonna be mad at Rachel! Yknow what? And Im just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
Monica	Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because youre the most important person in this room. And in the world!
Monica	Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
Mrs. Green	Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay. (Hugs Rachel while she is standing and Rachel is sitting, seeing this Monica decides to join in on the hugging by hugging Mrs. Green from behind her back.)
Monica	It is going to be okay! (Mrs. Green glances over her shoulder and glares at Monica while she heads for the bathroom.) It was worth a shot.
Rachel	Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
Monica	Its frightening.
Monica	(laughs) Youre still so funny. Youre so funny. (To Phoebe) What do I do?
Monica	Yknow what? Youre-youre right.
Monica	Really?
Monica	Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monica follows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasnt on purpose! But what youre during to me now is just plain spiteful!
Monica	Thats right! Maybe its time you took a good hard look at a mirror young ladyold ladylady!
Phoebe	(To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up
Monica	So whenever youre ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! (Monica and Phoebe reenter the apartment and Monica closes the door on a stunned Mrs. Green.) I cant feel my legs!
Monica	Yeah? Im proud of me too.
Monica	Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
Monica	Okay. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs. Green.) Mrs. Green! Okay Im really sorry!! Im apologizing for the(She trips and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Okay, I bit my tongue, but Im still really sorry!
Ross	No, Monicas restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all gasp.) I didnt want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)
Monica	(entering) Hey!
Monica	(seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Monica	(reading) Oh dear God!
Monica	What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Monica	Oh my God, this is horrible!
Monica	Im so humiliated!
Monica	You dont think that umm, (reading) "The chefs Mahi Mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
Monica	Is he right? Am I reallyAm I awful?
Joey	Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And Im not just saying this because Im your friend, Im sayin it cause its the truth. Youre food is abysmal!
Joey	(entering) Hey uh Monica, I cant remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?
Monica	We said at the movies, but
Monica	Joey! (He returns) Now that youre here
Monica	Hey Joey, come taste this.
Monica	Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well (Feeds him a spoonful of what shes cooking.) Im getting my revenge!
Monica	No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
Monica	Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.
Monica	I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
Monica	Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?
Monica	I can.
Monica	Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
Monica	Monica.
The Cooking Teacher	Monica, you go to the head of the class.
Monica	Okay. (Does so.)
The Cooking Teacher	(To Monica) Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station! (She tries Monicas fettuccini.) Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
Monica	Oh no! I dont know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
Monica	I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
Monica	Thats right.
The Cooking Teacher	Ah Monica, my star student.
Monica	Yknow, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star. (Hands it to her.)
Monica	Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and Im sorry, but I dont care.
Monica	Joey! Im so proud of you!
Monica	Excuse me? He doesnt even know what hes doing!
Monica	I do! Im a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax! Its not a courtroom drama!
Monica	Im-Im sorry, its just that umm Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandros, and umm I just got a really bad review
Monica	You do?
Monica	Oh, Im totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
Monica	Okay then, I dont stink. Im a good chef. Okay. (Starts to leave.)
Monica	Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Are we gonna take a limo?
Monica	Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Rachel	Thats right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the couch) Come on people! Please make some room!
Monica	What are you doing here so early?
Joey	(to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Monica	Well, well Ross didnt care enough to be here, so I think hes out. You snooze you lose.
Monica	Well then somebodys snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)
Monica	Star in a movie.
Monica	Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots youre gonna take him? Joey, I dont think youre comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
Monica	Shes over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
Monica	Hmm, care to make it interesting? Ill bet you that shell have it by this time tomorrow.
Monica	Okay, how much?
Monica	How about fifty bucks?
Phoebe	No ones here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!
Monica	Damnit! Damnit!! Heres your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)
Monica	Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Shes in the bathroom.
Rachel	Oh uh-uh pal! Dont call me mommy! Its bad enough you call your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)
Monica	Im actually with her on this one.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
Monica	Well what is it? What is it? If its gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
Monica	Do it!
Ross	Monica!
Monica	Im just saying its been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!
Monica	All right, lets be practical, if Ross isnt willing to do it, hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow ChandlerChandler is good!
Ross	Monica, what is the matter with you?
Monica	Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
Monica	Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that youre gonna have the baby and I dont want to lose again!
Monica	Wait a minute! Now Im betting against all three of you?
Monica	Oh, okay!
Monica	Two hundred.
Monica	Thats it. Im done. I dont care when the baby comes, no more betting.
Monica	Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I guess we can bet one more time.
Monica	How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joeys apartment.) Joey! Chandler!! Its time!
Monica	You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. (Phoebe isnt interested.) I bet you it has hair. (Shes still not interested.) I bet you its a girl.
Monica	(following her) Ill give you really good odds.
Monica	How are you doing?
Monica	We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Monica	Hey, you wanna see something?
Monica	Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
Monica	Listen uh, I-Ive been doing some thinking, and I dont know whether its because were here or Rachels giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
Monica	(freaking out) What-what-whats that now?!
Monica	What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think were ready to have a baby now?!
Monica	Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
Monica	Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
Monica	Thats it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
Monica	Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
Monica	What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
Monica	What?
Monica	We are pretty good.
Monica	Well maybe Im ready now. I mean, its a little scary, but maybe its right.
Monica	What?!!
Monica	So were gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
Monica	Okay, hold on a sec.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Well, we could start trying. Now.
Monica	No, not here. Maybe here.
Monica	And its so clean!!
Monica	I think we found a place.
Monica	Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
Monica	Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
Monica	Okay. Lets hurryOh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at her.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)
Monica	We could, or we can have sex in it.
Monica	(lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!
Monica	Does that sound like Janice?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	I cant believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Rachel	Here. (Hands her to Monica.)
Monica	Oh my God! Shes amazing. Oh, oh Im so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
Monica	Whats the matter?
Monica	Its okay honey, youll find a name.
Monica	Yeah, Ive had them picked out since I was fourteen.
Monica	Umm, okay. If its a boy its Daniel.
Monica	I dont want to say.
Monica	Okay. Its Emma.
Monica	Take it.
Monica	Its clearly an Emma.
Monica	Yeah, but I love you more. Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing. So Im screwed. I mean (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, thats you. Youre our little Em. Oh whats that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!
Monica	I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
Monica	(entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look whos here!
Monica	Oh, Aunt Liddys coming? That means we get five dollars each!
Phoebe	(To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.
Monica	About what?
Monica	Isnt she beautiful?
Mr. Geller	Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. (To Monica, mouths) Wow.
Joey	(laughs) Now lets not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)
Monica	I want a baby.
Monica	Come on! Come on, if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closets still available?
Monica	Deal!
Chandler	Hello sir, you know Monica.
Monica	Oh, I still cant believe my dad saw us having sex! He didnt make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
Monica	Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
Monica	It wasnt fun?!
Chandler	(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would youWh-why (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we want.
Monica	The truth is, Dad, were-were trying.
Monica	Yeah, were trying to get pregnant.
Monica	Well, thats okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
Monica	Daddy?!
Monica	Daddy! I dont think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
Monica	I dont feel good right now.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	Well, nows a good time. Im on my way to have my ears cut off.
Monica	What?
Monica	Is he crazy?! You just had Rosss baby!
Monica	What?! Are you crazy? You just had Rosss baby! Its-its so inappropriate. No, its worse than that. Its wrong. Its It is bigger than mine! (Rachels engagement ring.)
Monica	You cant marry him!
Monica	Well do you love him?
Monica	Sure?
Monica	Honey, the question isdo you really want to marry Joey?
Joey	Youre right. Youre right. I-Ill go tell her now before Ross finds out and Ill be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if you want to check that out.
Monica	(walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!
Monica	Ok, I dont wanna be negative so Ill say that most of the signs you bought are good.
Monica	(looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy. (Waking him up.) Honey.
Monica	Honey why dont you go lie down.
Monica	Phoebe did the signs!
Monica	Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
Monica	Wow, hes really not letting this go, is he?
Monica	Breaks your heart doesnt it
Monica	Alright heres something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Monica	It worked!
Monica	Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
Monica	Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
Monica	Try feeding her again.
Monica	I know, thats why I said again!
Monica	Hey.
Chandler	Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Monica	Okay whats up
Monica	Oh yeah (smiles).
Monica	What? Who says that?
Monica	Whats going on?
Monica	Excuse me?
Monica	(stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!
Monica	Chandler, I dont even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
Monica	Are you trying to tell me that were moving to Oklahoma, or that youre gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
Chandler	No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monicas not impressed.) Ill get out of it.
Monica	Thank you.
Monica	Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Monica	About a week and a half.
Phoebe	Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so Im just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)
Monica	Rach, try holding her a different way.
Monica	Youre just new at this, itll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldnt have been easy but you figured that out.
Monica	Okay Ill take her, here. (Takes Emma)
Monica	(To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)
Monica	It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
Monica	I cant believe it! Shes asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!
Phoebe	I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! (Monica looks at her strangely) Im kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)
Monica	Yes I did, Im Monica, Super Aunt
Monica	Yes I am!!
Monica	Say what?
Monica	(stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!
Monica	What?
Rachel	You know the book says that whenever shes sleeping I should be sleeping so (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)
Monica	Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
Monica	No.
Monica	(loudly) What!?
Rachel	No its really okay Monica!
Monica	(comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
Rachel	(To Monica) Do you have to go?
Monica	I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing (Points to her wedding ring.)
Monica	Hey!
Monica	You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Monica	It's great! How?
Monica	So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks about it.) No.
Monica	No. I can't be away from you for that long.
Monica	Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Monica	Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
Monica	I know! (They high-five.)
Rachel	Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
Monica	Excuse me?
Monica	Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Monica	He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
Monica	Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
Monica	Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
Monica	That I was going to eat him.
Scene	(Monica Enters. Chandler is in the kitchen with his laptop)
Monica	Hey!
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	That's so sweet. Find anything?
Monica	Nothing, huh?
Monica	'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
Monica	Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
Monica	(On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?) is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo (sp?) 'I'll take it!'
Monica	You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.
Monica	So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Monica	Manhattan.
Monica	I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Monica	Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
Monica	Really?
Monica	That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Monica	How was the pediatrician?
Monica	Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Monica	Where have you been?
Monica	Promise to call me when you land.
Monica	I love you too. (They kiss)
Monica	(Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you. This is just something I have to do.
Monica	I love you so much.

Monica	Ok (sits down next to him) This is how much I love you. (She presses play then puts her arm around Chandler's neck.)
Monica	Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
Monica	: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
Monica	: Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
Monica	: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
Monica	I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
Monica	then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
Monica	really?
Monica	I cannot tell you how happy that makes me! (They hug)
Chandler	You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.

Monica	Oh sure, now youre Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncles funeral
Monica	No, youre right. Mnya, we shouldnt do it like this. Huch. For what its worth, Im, Im sorry. I shouldnt have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
Monica	Yah.
Monica	Dyou want to?
Monica	kay.
Monica	You know what? Lets not talk.
Monica	Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
Monica	Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
Monica	I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldnt have sex with me while were fighting.
Monica	Thats right, I got mine.
Monica	(entering with husband) Happy birthday!
Monica	Well, we had a little fight.
Monica	You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isnt it? How dyou get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
Chandler	I suppose that Monica will have the  manipulative shrew.
Monica	Why would you do that?
Monica	Moms here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
Joey	(to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you two?
Monica	Uch, you see, Im ovulating.
Monica	Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just cant get enough.
Monica	Bye.
Monica & Chandler	Mhum.
Monica	So, Im, Im probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
Monica	We dont have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct 
Monica	(in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Monica	YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Monica	Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
Monica	Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)
Monica	Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Monica	Oh, well... That had been your window.
Monica	Really? The scientist guy?
Monica	Continue...
Monica	Phoebe!
Monica	Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Monica	What are you gonna do?
Monica	You have to tell David!
Monica	Heeeeeey!
Chandler	So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Monica	(Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?
Chandler	What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Monica	No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Monica	Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)
Chandler	Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
Chandler	Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
Chandler	Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)
Monica	Hi! There you are.
Joey	(sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says "you're welcome" without a sound)
Monica	Yeah! I think that's great!
Monica	Oh... How are they?
Monica	Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Joey	Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Monica	Yeah, so?
Monica	Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Monica	I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Joey	Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)
Chandler	You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)
Monica	Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
Monica	Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)
Monica	Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)
Monica	Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
Monica	Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
Monica	Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.
Monica	Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
Monica	Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
Chandler	I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)
Joey	(to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?
Monica	Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
Monica	What do you do with your money now?
Monica	Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Joey	(laughs) Yeah! Right! (points at Monica) People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird." (laughs again) Or... or maybe just a wing or... (realises...)
Monica	Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. (looks at Chandler) That's right, I know some stuff!
Monica	(very excited) Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
Chandler	(imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
Monica	My dad told me. They play golf together.
Rachel and Monica	Hey!
Monica	Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
Monica	They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
Phoebe	Okay, so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up two 'Phoebe' dresses, Rachel and Monica look at them... taking their time, don't wanting to hurt Phoebe) You can say "neither".
Rachel and Monica	Oh God, neither!
Monica	I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
Monica	You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Monica	I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Monica	(Monica looks at Rachel in disbelief) She said WHAT?
Phoebe	(speaking louder and articulating) That's she's like the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears) Listen! (Monica looks at Phoebe in a duh! way)
Chandler	We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey looks around)
Chandler	There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Joey	Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... (realises) Wait a minute... This says Monica... (looks around) And this is Richard's apartment... (realises some more)
Joey	You don't wanna see what I just saw! (at this moment Monica comes home, and sees Chandler flat on his back on the floor and Joey pinning him down)
Monica	What are you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning coming from the TV and looks at it) Oh my God, is that Richard? (It only takes a split second for Joey to realise, he pulls Monica down by her jacket, and she falls, face down next to Chandler. Chandler gets up a bit, and Joey quickly covers Chandler's eyes with his hand.)
Monica	So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Monica	That tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
Joey	(laughs) Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... (Monica keeps looking at Joey) Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later. (Joey walks out)
Monica	Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
Monica	Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
Monica	Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
Monica	Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
Monica	Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! (she turns on the video again)
Monica	THAT'S NOT ME!
Monica	That bastard taped over me! (Chandler's expression changes)
Monica	I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
Rachel	Shake it! (Phoebe, Mike, Chandler, Monica and Joey step in)
Monica	Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
Monica	No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Monica	What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
Monica	Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..
Monica	<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.
Monica and Chandler's Apartment	Monica and Chandler's Apartment.
Monica	Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful. CAREFUL!
Monica	I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.
Monica	well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.
Rachel	Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Monica and Chandler's apartmen	Monica and Chandler's apartment
Ross to Monica	Hi.
Monica to Ross	Hi.
Monica to Emma	Hey you.
Monica to Amy	So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
"<Monica and Amy turn away and walk into the living room towards the secret
 closet"	<Monica and Amy turn away and walk into the living room towards the secret closet>
Ross	Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
Monica	yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.
Rachel	See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
Chandler	You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>
Monica	Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
Monica	Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>
Monica	No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
Rachel	Monica is Ross' sister.
Monica	That was me.
Monica about to have a heart attack	Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.
"<Monica holds a turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat
 off with a knife"	<Monica holds a turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat off with a knife>
Monica	Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.
Chandler	No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
Chandler	So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
Ross	Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Monica	Thats not how you see me, is it?
Ross	Sure, Monica would have to give her up.
Scene	Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.
Monica	Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
Monica	Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
Monica	No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Monica	I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
Monica	Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
Monica	How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.
Scene	Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment.
Scene	Monica and Chandler come through the front door.
Monica	Oh wait.. What are you doing?
Monica	Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.
Scene	<Amy pushes Rachel and Monica goes berserk and runs around the table>
Monica	Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
Monica	Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time!
Scene	<Everyone is shocked and Monica faints and Ross catches her>
Chandler	Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
Ross	Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
Monica	uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
Monica	Thank you. It was so beautiful. <gets up and walks towards the front door> I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
Monica	I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
Phoebe	Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
Chandler	Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
Monica	Like only if the queen comes?
Monica	Bye plates!
Monica	What? Something happened with the plates?
CHANDLER	That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
CHANDLER	(Hangs his jacket over the suitcase, locks the door, then turns to Monica.) Oh well, look at you.
CHANDLER	It's Joey. (He answers it, holding it out so that Monica can hear too.) Hey Joe.
JOEY	I don't know how to tell you this but, uh ... I think Monica's cheatin' on ya. I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
CHANDLER	Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? (Monica tips her head slightly as if asking "Did you hear yourself?") I heard it.
CHANDLER	(To Monica) What is he doing?
JOEY	(sniffing the air and then Monica.) Why do I smell men's cologne?
JOEY	Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry.
CHANDLER	(thinks, then turns to Monica) I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
CHANDLER	I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know ... I didn't think you'd understand.
CHANDLER	I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
Monica	I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Monica	It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
Monica	It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
Monica	(shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Monica	No!
Monica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!	Monica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"
Rachel	We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler	No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Rachel	Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Monica	Come on Ben.
Monica	Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
Monica	(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
Monica	Yeah, is that okay?
Monica	No.
Monica	Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Monica	So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Monica	Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
Monica	Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
Monica	Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
Monica	What does she do there?
Monica	She did WHAT?
Monica	
Monica	Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Okay!
Monica	Merry Christmas.
Monica	Really?
Monica	Well, not anymore.
Monica	I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Monica	Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Monica	Okay!
Monica	(breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?
Monica	This doesn't feel weird!
Monica	You're a really good kisser.
Monica	Hm-hmm!
Monica	Wow! You are really fast!
Monica	We're gonna see each other naked.
Monica	Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Monica	One!
Monica	Two!
Monica	Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Monica	Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
Monica	I think you're better than you think you are.
Monica	(interrupting) Know when to stop.
Monica	Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around:) Don't do the dance.
Monica	I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Monica	You're so efficient. I love you!
Monica	No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
Monica	That'll work!
Monica	Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Monica	That's stealing!
Monica	Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
Monica	Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Monica	Eh, you work for that.
Monica	You do?!
Monica	Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Monica	You thought about that?
Monica	How many kids were we gonna have?
Monica	What else did you think about?
Monica	(laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Monica	No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
Monica	Uh-hmm.
Monica	I love you. (They kiss.)
Monica	"Wendy" is a fat girl name.
Monica	Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Monica	What are you doing here?
Chandler	Monica.
Monica	But I thought if you left, you get fired.
Monica	What?
Monica	Oh my god!
Monica	No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
Chandler	(to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)
Chandler	Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
Monica	You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
Monica	Would you stop staring at her?
Monica	What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
Monica	Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
Monica	They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
Joey	Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)
Monica	(to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)
Monica	Hey Rach!
Monica	Ready for your birthday lunch?
Rachel	Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.
Monica	Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Monica	You were just being so nice to him!
Monica	Right there! That was so fake!
Rachel	(to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
Monica	Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
Monica	Does he?
Monica	Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
Rachel	Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
Rachel	Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Monica	Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)
Monica	Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
Monica	So this is what a stroke feels like.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
Monica	Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).
Monica	Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
Monica	(from inside) Again, you're welcome.
Rachel	Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Monica	Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
Monica	Oh my god.
Monica	Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
Monica	You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
Monica	Oh, it's perfect.
Monica	Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	No, it's not.
Monica	Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
Monica	Chandler!
Monica	We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
Monica	So, let's do this.
Monica	Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
Monica	Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
Monica	Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
Monica	Canoodling?
Monica	I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
Monica	I guess you're right.
Monica	But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
Monica	She's asleep. Chandler?
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	She's asleep.
Monica	Yes, but we have to be fast.
Monica	Okay, I'll try.
Monica	Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
Monica	Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
Monica	Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Monica	Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
Monica	Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
Monica	Hey, Rach, how's it going?
Rachel	Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? (To Monica.) What's up?
Monica	Hey, did you stop by here?
Monica	Oh my god, then...
Monica	Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
Monica	Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just  she loves it when I'm dramatic.
Monica	Why the hell did you take her?
Monica	No, we weren't!
Chandler	All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
Monica	No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
Monica	Unless what?
Ross	Monica told me you had a blind date.
Joey	Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
Monica	(shocked) Really? (She looks around, suddenly embarrassed) Let's get past the moment.
Monica	(hugging Chandler) Oh, honey, that's incredible!
Monica	Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
Monica	Hey!
Joey	Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. (Monica smiles) ... and I smelled bacon. (taking some)
Monica	He just left.
Joey	(puzzled) Who did? (Monica looks bewildered)
Monica	What is she talking about?
Monica	Is it a good play?
Monica	(sighs) He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
Monica	No, but I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.
Rachel and Joey	(pointing at Monica, a look of recognition in their faces) Ah!
Monica	Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
Monica	Hey, how did the audition go?
Monica	What happened?
Monica	So far so good! (Joey nods)
Monica	(standing up, walking towards him) What's wrong?
Monica	So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
Monica	What are they? (They sit down again)
Monica	Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
Chandler	Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". (He takes a sneaker) And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! (to Monica) Would you help me try to sell these?
Monica	Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
Monica	You okay?!
Monica	(bewildered) How do you know a mugger?
Monica	(shocked) Seriously?
Monica	(disapproving) Phoebe, that is awful!
Monica	You're mother killed herself!
Monica	Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
Monica	Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.
Monica	(coughing) Wonderwoman!
Ross	Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone (He looks at Monica)  when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "Gimme your money, punk!"
Monica	Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
Monica	That's it.
Monica	What?
Monica	Yeah?
Monica	So?
Phoebe and Monica	"Geology rocks!"
Monica	Oh my god!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	No, that seems about right.
Monica	Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn on a Saturday afternoon?! (shocked) I was in the house!
Monica	that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
Monica	everybody we know? Yeah.
Monica	I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
Monica	I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
Monica	Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
Monica	Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Monica	Why not?
Monica	Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
Monica	Hey Joey!
Monica	Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
Monica	(Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
Joey	Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
Monica	But Chandler lent you money!
Monica	Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
Monica	Two thousand dollars?
Monica	Yeah...
Joey & Monica	Hey!
Monica	Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Rachel	Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Monica	You're a pig. And you can't do this.
Monica, Chandler, Ross	Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Monica	Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like" (Looks at Chandler)
Monica	Is that a bit you guys do?
Monica	We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Monica	I hear wedding bells.
Phoebe	Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
Monica	Don't you mean..groomy?
Chandler	Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
Joey	I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Chandler	And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
Chandler (Stands up and walks to Joey)	Listen...this is really nice. Do you... (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
Monica	I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Mike	Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.
Monica	So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Monica	Thank you?
Monica	Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Monica	Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
Monica	Okay...
Monica	I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
Monica	Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Monica	You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
Monica	Honey?
Monica	About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Monica	I'm going to get bigger!
Monica	Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Monica	It's kind of a package deal!
Monica	I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Rachel	Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Monica	Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
Monica, Rachel, Chandler	It's over/Joe!
Chandler/Joey/Rachel/Monica	Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Monica	We're all sorry... (They have a group hug)
Monica	Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Phoebe	Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
Monica	Ok, you got it!
Monica	Really? If that's what you want...
Monica	Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Monica	Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) "gay as the day is long"?
Monica	But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)
Monica	(On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Chandler	Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).
Monica	What are you doing?
Monica	Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
Monica	What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Monica	Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.
Monica	And now your cell.
Phoebe	Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)
Monica	This is your cellphone?
Monica	This is your current cellphone?
Monica	Phoebe, where's your purse?
Monica	No, no! Give it to me!
Monica	Give it to me!
Monica	I'll go in there.
Monica	Phoebe come here
Monica	Haha!
Phoebe	Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
Monica	Haha!
Monica	So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
Monica	Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
Phoebe	Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
Monica	Who's that? (goes to open door)
Monica	(To Mike) What are you doing here?
Monica	Phoebe!
Monica	Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Monica	Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Monica	(to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!
Monica	Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
Monica	Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).
Monica	Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
Monica	I've been pretty good!
Monica	Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Monica	You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
Joey	It's Monica, ok?
Rachel	That's not Monica!
Monica	Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
Monica	(running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!
Monica	Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
Monica	Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
Monica	Excuse me?
Monica	Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
Monica	You didn't hear the speech!
Monica	Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
Monica	You're... weird!
Monica	Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
Monica	Damn it!
Monica	And I blame you too.
Monica	Hi, glad you could come.
Monica	So, did you know Ross well?
Monica	(a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.
Monica	I look like a man??
Chandler	You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
Monica	You are married though.
Ross	(on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?
Joey	Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
Monica	Ok.
Monica	But ehm...what is it not?
Monica	And what else is it not?
Monica	Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need it for anyway?
Monica	Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
Monica	Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Monica	How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Monica	God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
Monica	Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
Monica	(smiling)That was a good day!
Ross	(yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
Monica	I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
Monica	(to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
Ross	(to Monica)Think he washed his hands?
Rachel	(to Monica)What's going on?
Monica	Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
Monica	Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!
Monica	Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
Monica	Alright, who wants to do it?
Monica	Ok, hey Rach?
Monica	Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?
Monica	Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
Monica	I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
Rachel, Chandler and Monica	Please, just do it!
Monica	You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
Monica	Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
Monica	Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
Monica	Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)
Monica	Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
Monica	I'm sorry, idea time is over.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Monica	Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
Monica	Chandler, sense the tone!!
Monica	Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
Monica	Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
Monica	When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
Rachel	Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
Monica	Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
Monica	Ahhh! (shocked)
Monica	There's the man I married!!
Monica	Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
Monica	No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl) and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
Joey	Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)
Everyone but Monica	Friends!
Monica	Money! (they all look at her) Friends...
Phoebe	Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
Monica	They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)...
Ross	Monica!
Monica	Phoebe, we lost half of them.
Phoebe	So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
Monica	Oh, play them!
Monica	Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
Monica	(she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
Monica	(she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants) 131! (they kiss)
Monica	We are on a roll, people!!
Monica	Check your numbers! Make me rich!
Monica	Make me rich!!
Monica	Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!
Monica	(answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Monica	Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
Monica	You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area)
Chandler	(smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
Monica and Ross	Seven.
Monica	Let me see!
Monica	You know what? You can have mine.
Monica	Hey!
Monica	So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
Monica	Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
Chandler	(To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
Chandler	What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!
Monica	Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
Monica	Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
Monica	Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
Monica	Why don't you take Ross?
Monica	No, not if their room has two beds!
Monica	Thank you!
Monica	Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...
Monica	Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
Monica	What musician?
Monica	What are you doing here!
Monica	Great!
Monica	Listen Phoebe...
Monica	You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Monica	This is kind of a classy place.
Phoebe	(with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh?
Joey	Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Monica	Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
Monica	What do you think brought than on?
Monica	A love scene? With who?
Monica	Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.
Monica	I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Monica	Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
Monica	It was hard!
Rachel and Monica	Hi.
Phoebe	Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
Monica	Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
Monica	Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
Monica	I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Monica	Tiny portions?
Monica	Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
Monica	Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
Phoebe	Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
Monica	Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
Monica	You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
Monica	Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Phoebe	You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
Monica	Ok, you have to stop playing now.
Monica	Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Phoebe	(while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Monica	(to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)
Monica	Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).
Monica	Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
Monica	Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)
Monica	I'm sorry...
Monica	ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
Monica	(without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!
Monica	It sounds interesting!
Rachel	Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
Monica	No, no, Rachel?
Monica	Who do you wanna fool around with?
Monica	(whispering) You can't!
Rachel	(whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with "because") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Monica	In the hall.
Monica	You wanna fool around with Joey?
Monica	Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Monica	Who, who are they?
Monica	Both of them?
Monica	Which one?
Monica	Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
Monica	What the hell are you cooking!
Monica	Hey!
Ross	(covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
Monica	What's so bad about that?
Monica	(fingering her elbow): Ross?
Monica	(to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?
Chandler	(to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Monica	(to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Ross	(hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
Ross	(entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
Monica	(to Ross) So, did you two have fun?
Monica	And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!
Monica	Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Rachel	Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...
Monica	You're not sick!
Monica	Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??
Monica	You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Monica	Ok, what is this?
Monica	(aloud) WHAT?
Monica	Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Monica	The game's over! Take off your robe!
Monica	Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Kyle Lowder	(to Monica) Hi. (walks on)
Monica	(Yells after him) I love you!
Monica	Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Monica	(Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
Phoebe	Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)
Monica	(Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!
Monica	(to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".
Monica	Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Monica	(yelling after him) We will!!
Monica	(to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!
Monica	I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Monica	Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)
Monica	That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).
Joey	Monica!
Monica	Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
Chandler	(to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?
Monica	Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
Monica	You really liked it?
Monica	Oh really!
Monica	No!
Monica	So I got it when I was 13...
Rachel	(to Monica) Hey!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Monica	That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Monica	What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Monica	Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Monica	And I can't stop you.
Monica	Oh, you're so wonderful.
Monica	It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
Monica	Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Hey, what's this?
Monica	Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
Monica	Do you wanna go hunting?
Monica	And she wants to go hunting, too!!
Monica	(entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!
Monica	Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?
Chandler	Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)
Monica	Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Monica	Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
Monica	What is the big deal?
Monica	It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Monica	Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
Monica	(really embarrassed) OH!
Monica	Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
Monica	Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
Monica	I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
Monica	Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
Monica	This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves)
Monica	So, what's your name?
Janice	Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
Monica	Hey sweetie.
Monica	With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
Monica	What?
Monica	Oh... what does that mean?
Monica	Chandler?
Monica	(weeping) Oh my God!
Monica	I'm sorry too.
Monica	(still weeping) I know.
Monica	Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Monica	Hi.
Monica	Ok.
Monica	Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
Monica	(long pause) Ok.
Chandler	Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
Rachel	Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Monica	Hi honey!
Monica	Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
Zack	(shaking Monica's hand) You too.
Monica	I got it.
Monica	Yeah, I guess.
Monica	(turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?
Monica	Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
Monica	Chandler!
Monica	I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
Monica	Uh!
Monica	Tell me about yourself, Zack!
Monica	Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
Monica	Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
Monica	I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
Monica	Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
Monica	Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
Monica	We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
Chandler	You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an "ok" sign)
Monica & Chandler	Sure! Alright...
Monica	Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)
Monica	Does seem pretty perfect.
Monica	(pause) No.
Monica	No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
Monica	No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Monica	Yeah, I'm sure.
Monica	That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)
Monica	Adoption.
Monica	I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
Monica	So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Monica	(excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
Monica	And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived.
Monica	David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
Monica	(to Chandler) See?
Monica	Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Phoebe	Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
Monica	(pinching her) Let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)
Monica	At least you took me down with you!
Monica	I guess, in time.
Monica	I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Chandler	David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
Monica	Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Chandler	(smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) "I do".
Monica	Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
Monica	What? (looks very shocked) Why?
Monica	Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Monica	They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
Rachel	Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
Monica	Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
Monica	(to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
Monica	(shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe).
Monica	Yeah, right!
Chandler	(slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)
Chandler	Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)
Monica	Ok!
Monica	See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Monica	Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?
Monica	(looking very serious) I need to talk to you.
Phoebe	Are you leaving "The Supremes"? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)
Monica	What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Monica	Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Chandler	Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)
Monica	Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
Monica	This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
Monica	I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)
Monica	You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? (Mike hangs up the phone) Damnit!
Monica	(sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!
Monica	Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Monica	No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
Monica	No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
Monica	Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Monica	I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Monica	Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Mike	Hi David. Chandler. Monica... (Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!
Monica	IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
David	That's fair, you've had a long trip. (he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)
Monica	You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring...
Monica	(to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
Monica	I know (she snuggles to him)
Monica	The sun is out!
Monica	Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Monica	Damn it!
Rachel	All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	(her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
Monica	So, what are we gonna do today?
Monica	(pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
Monica	(disappointed) Why not?
Monica	I'm not always that bad!
Monica	(hesitatingly) I punched you...?
Monica	... Phoebe...?
Monica	I clunked your heads together!
Monica	C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
Monica	But then how do we know who wins?
Monica	So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
Monica	(smiling) OK!
Mike	(disbelieving) I think I will be all right! (to Monica) You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
Monica	Sure! Got to!
Monica	Aww!
Monica	Hell, yeah!
Monica	How much were you thinking?
Monica	Make it fifty!
Monica	(nearly shouting) One thousand...
Monica	(going through her pockets) No... (to Chandler and Phoebe) Either of you girls got a quarter?
Phoebe	(picks up a coin from her bra) Monica, you call it.
Monica	Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
Monica	(angry) Ow, what are the chances!
Monica	Ha! My point!
Monica	Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
Monica	Ah, yeah!
Monica	Ah, yeaaah!
Monica	AH YEAAAAH!
Phoebe	(looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
Monica	Oh, damn it!
Monica	(threatening) Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
Monica	NO, NO, NOOO!
Monica	Best out of three?
Monica	(to Mike) Serve the ball, chump!
Mike	(doing Monica and mumbling): Serve the ball, chump.
Monica	No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Chandler	Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
Monica	I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
Monica	Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
Monica	That's just good sense!
Monica	(in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)
Monica	No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause) Oh my God! I can't play!
Monica	I can't believe it! (pause) I lost!
Monica	What?
Monica	(to Chandler) Honey, you don't have to do this.
Monica	But... you suck!
Monica	Oh my God! You're good!
Monica	(to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike) loser! (back to Chandler) When did you stop sucking?
Monica	Why?
Monica	This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Monica	Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)
Monica	I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
Monica	What's up?
Monica	Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
Monica	Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
Monica	Oh my God, that's Charlie!
Monica	I'm not sure about this.
Monica	No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
Monica	What?
Monica	(in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
Monica	(muffled) Thank you.
Monica	I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
Monica	I'm on it!
Monica	I think I hear curtains closing...
Monica	Bedsprings, unmistakable!
Monica	Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
Chandler	That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Monica	Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
Monica	Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
Monica	(also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to Phoebe)
Chandler	He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)
Monica	Other wall, people! Other wall!
Monica, Chandler and Phoebe	YE-AH!
Monica	Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
Chandler	Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
Phoebe	Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
Monica	Check it out!
Monica	What do you think?
Monica	Don't you just love it?
Monica	And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle)
Monica	Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!
Monica	Yeah!
Monica	Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)
Monica	It's "Bolero" from "10".
Monica	You what? You said you liked them.
Monica	Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
Monica	You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!
Monica	And the eye!
Monica	Not really.
Monica	I have a problem.
Monica	Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
Monica	Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)
Monica	(looking disappointed) I guess so...
Monica	Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
Monica	Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...
Monica	Sure, what do you have in mind?
Monica	Really? I don't really feel like it.
Monica	Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
Scene	Central Perk. Monica and Chandler are there. They have lots of brochures about adoption in front of them.
Monica	God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	That's sweet. Drink your hair.
Monica	Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
Monica	That's not really how it works.
Monica	I don't know!
Monica	Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
Monica	Hi Frank.
Monica	Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
Monica	Which one is which again?
Monica (reads a form in her lap)	"Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
Scene	Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler and Monica enter.
Monica	Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
Monica	Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Monica	Oh my god!
Monica	Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
Chandler	That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
Monica	It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Monica	Can I adopt you?
Scene	Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler comes running into the living room. Monica is the only one there.
Monica	They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Monica	Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
Monica	Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
Chandler (to Monica)	We have to get out of here, baby!
Scene	Central Perk. Monica and Chandler enter to find Phoebe there with the triplets.
Monica	Hey, Phoebs
Monica	Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
Chandler	Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Monica	What?
Monica	(entering) Hey!
Monica	(to Chandler) Hey sweetie! (they kiss)
Ross	(looking at Monica's legs) WOW!
Monica	Chandler gets pedicures!
Chandler	(To Monica) Why...why?
Monica	There. Here's their card.
Monica	Hey Phoebe!
Monica	I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
Monica	She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda using an awful British accent) "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
Monica	(pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets pedicures!
Monica	I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.
Monica	Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
Monica	What?
Monica	Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?
Monica	It could be Amanda!
Amanda	Hello Monica. It’s Amanda calling again. I am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!
Monica	You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
Amanda	Yes, I was looking for Monica.
Chandler	Hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.
Monica	We weren’t picking up, it’s Amanda!
Monica	Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
Monica	Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!
Monica	And you would?
Ross	Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
Monica	How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Monica	One Two Three...
Monica	Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Monica	Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
Monica	(sees what he is doing) Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
Monica	Hey Phoebe!
Monica	Is Amanda here yet?
Monica	(sits down) Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Monica	Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
Monica	Hi!
Amanda	(To Monica) Hello!
Amanda	(In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
Monica	(beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
Monica	When were we not friends?
Monica	Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
Amanda	(to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
Monica	(To Phoebe) You were going to cut me out?
Monica	Oh My God!
Monica	(Into the phone) Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)
Monica	We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Phoebe	Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Monica	I have nothing to say to you.
Phoebe	Please, Monica? In the hall?
Monica	I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Monica	I'm still all those things!
Monica	(starts smiling) I am scrappy.
Monica	It's because I'm scrappy.
Monica	I won't know what I would do without you.
Monica	Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Rachel	Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
Rachel	I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Monica	(she enters) Hey guys!
Monica	That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
Monica	Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
Monica	Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
Monica	All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Monica	Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
Monica	Hey!
Monica	All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Monica	Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
Monica	So glad you came!
Judy	(to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room! Ross: (pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know about your dad!
Monica	I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
Monica	I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
Chandler	I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Monica	Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
Monica	Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Monica	Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
Ross	Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!
Monica	We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
Monica	Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
Ross	You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
Monica	Alright, 5 more minutes.
Monica	No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) We've been complaining the longest!
Monica	No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Monica	Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
Monica	No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Monica	(She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.
Joey	Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
Monica	Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
Monica	Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)
Monica	Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
Monica	(to the dog) What are you barking at?
Monica	Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Monica	No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
Chandler	I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Monica	Game?
Monica	That's how old you are.
Monica	(embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...
Monica	...and head to Canada!
Monica	I wasn't. Let's get going!
Monica	What about your massage client?
Monica	Thanks!
Rachel	Okay. Ross: Okay, you ready? Rachel: Yeah. Ross: A-a-and... record. Rachel: Okay. (they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really... (There's a lot of yelling and screaming coming from the hallway, and they get up to look at what's the noise all about. In the hallway, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe are having another wind-up animal race, yelling and screaming fanatically.) Phoebe: (yelling at the top of her voice) Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard! end
Monica	Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
Monica	Thank you!
Monica	Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
Monica	Clearly we were wrong.
Monica	You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Monica	Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Monica	You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
Joey	(using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Monica	(also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense.
Monica	Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to Joey)
Monica	Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.
Monica	Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that' look). Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
Joey	Yeah, Monica made us!
Monica	Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
Monica	Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
Monica	Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
Monica	I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, moving on...
Monica	Thank you.
Monica	How about at a game, on the big screen?
Monica	What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
Rachel	(To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?
Monica	No, sorry sweety..
Monica	You dropped it off?
Joey	No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)
Monica	You hand-wrote it?
Monica	Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
Monica	Okay good.
Monica	Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
Monica	What?
Monica	(surprised) They thought Joey was a child?
Monica	Hey, what did you guys do today?
Ross	Hey guys. Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.
Monica	Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Ross	(sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?
Monica	I'm a cool, fun aunt!
Chandler	Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Monica	What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Chandler	Is Monica not here?
Monica	Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Monica	Oh, right.
Monica	Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Monica	Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up? Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
Monica	Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!
Monica	(faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
Monica	Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Monica	Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Monica	Damn it, I did not think this through!
Monica	Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
Monica	Wow, what's the bad news!
Rachel	(sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
Monica	Huh!
Rachel	Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
Monica	You know, I would give her up, for you.
Monica	But I want to.
Monica	But I insist!
Phoebe	Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!
Monica	No, that landed in your food!
Monica	(faking happiness) Oh, my!
Rachel	(surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)
Monica	(sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Monica	(offended) I like that poster!
Monica	(Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?
Joey	I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Monica	Hey! I sold that to Joey.
Rachel	Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)
Monica	No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes the painting back to Rachel)
Monica	No you can't. She's yours!
Monica	SHE'S YOURS!
Monica	She's m-i-i-ne!
Monica	She's mine!
Phoebe	You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)
Monica	She's mine!
Monica	She's mine!
Monica	Oh my God!
Chandler	It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Monica	(sarcastically) We?
Monica	And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Monica	Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
Monica	Chandler?
Monica	Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
Monica	It isn't mine!
Monica	Ok.
Monica	We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a box on the table and opens it). I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…
Monica	I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
Monica	That’s crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
Monica	That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
Monica	Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
Monica	Yay!
Monica	Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
Monica	Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
Monica	Would you like something to drink?
Monica	Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.
Monica	Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Monica	Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked)
Monica	Really? What is it?
Monica	Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Monica and Chandler	OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!
Monica	Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
Monica	Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!
Monica	(Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room?
Monica	So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey behind the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler)
Monica	(To Chandler) What room should we see next?
Monica	(laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom).
Laura	(embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
Monica	Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
Monica	Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)
Monica	It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
Monica	Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
Monica	Hey guys!
Monica	We need to talk to you about something.
Ross	(skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Monica	No, it's not!
Monica	Thank you, Pheebs!
Monica	What? You are way off, lady!
Monica	That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Monica	Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
Monica	You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Monica	No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Monica	2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
Monica	This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
Monica	(Chandler's laughing) Did someone drop the baton again?
Monica	(she tastes what she has cooked) I don't get older. I just get better!
Monica	You don't know that.
Monica	Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
Monica	Name one of his books.
Monica	Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
Monica	Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
Monica	Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
Monica	Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)
Chandler	Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Monica	Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Ross	So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Monica	Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)
Monica	Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
Monica	(gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Monica	Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Phoebe	We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
Rachel	You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
Phoebe	Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
Monica	No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Chandler	Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?
Monica	(Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.
Monica	That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
Rachel	(gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
Monica	Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Chandler	Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)
Chandler	HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Monica	Stinky?!
Monica	Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
Joey	(still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
Joey	Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?
Monica	Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
Monica	(Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
Monica	Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Phoebe	Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).
Monica	Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Monica	Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Monica	It's too late for apologies.
Monica	The three of us?
Monica	Joey, that is not gonna work.
Monica	Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Monica	Bring it.
Monica	Here you go!
Monica	Okay, try it.
Monica	Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
Monica	Chandler, where are your tools?
Monica	I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
Monica	Oh!
Monica	Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
Chandler	Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
Chandler	(to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
Monica	(very emotional) I don't care.
Monica	That was the adoption agency...
Monica	WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Monica	There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
Monica	This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
Rachel	To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
Monica	I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)
Monica	Hey!
Monica	Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Monica	She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Monica	And a lot could still get in our way.
Monica	Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Monica	You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Monica	Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)
Monica	Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Monica	Uh, we're gonna be great.
Monica	Well... obviously!
Agency guy	(he enters with Erica) Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
Monica	Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Erica	So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
Monica	I don't know about that.
Monica	(overlapping) Let her finish, doctor.
Scene	The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are still talking with Erica.
Monica	Amen.
Monica	Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands.
Monica	It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Erica	I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
Monica	Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
Monica	We don’t?
Monica	Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?
Monica	(to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!
Monica	Why not?
Monica	God works in mysterious ways.
Monica	But she liked us.
Chandler	She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Monica	Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)
Monica	C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Monica	(very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Monica	I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
Monica	(Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close.
Chandler	Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. Monica: (realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug)
Monica	(sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Monica	Technicality!
Monica	(pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?
Erica	Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler)
Monica	Look, doctor!
Chandler	Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Monica	Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)
Monica	Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
Monica	But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Monica	Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Monica	God bless you Chandler Bing!
Monica	(really excited) Mmh... this cake is amazing!
Monica	I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
Monica	(with no hesitation) Sex!
Monica	Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
Phoebe	Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Monica	Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
Monica	Nancy doesn’t smoke!
Monica	So? What do you think of the house?
Monica	Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
Monica	Don’t you love the huge yard?
Monica	And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
Monica	So? Do you think we should get it?
Monica	I think we should.
Monica	This is huge!
Monica	How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
Monica	Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Monica	Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Joey	Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
Monica	If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Monica	No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?
Monica (puzzled)	All right...
Monica	What?
Monica	Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
Joey	(walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
Monica	Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)
Monica	(goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Monica	(turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Monica	Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
Monica	When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Monica	And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
Monica	And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
Monica	(smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)
Monica	We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?
Rachel	Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Monica	Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Monica	Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
Monica	Every year.
Phoebe	Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Monica	Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
Monica	I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Monica	Deal!
Ross	What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Ross	Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Monica	Maurice.
Monica	It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Monica	That’s not even a word!
Monica	NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Monica	Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
Ross	Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Chandler	(To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
Monica	(She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Chandler	Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Monica	I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
Monica	Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Monica and Rachel	What?!
Monica	Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
Monica	When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Monica	When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Monica	And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
Monica	She really left.
Monica	Thank you.
Monica	Can I ask you a question?
Monica	What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
Monica	And?
Chandler	(to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
Monica	We can't afford that.
Monica	Well, there you go.
Phoebe	(to Monica) You're gonna be okay?
Monica	Yeah, we'll be okay.
Ross	Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)
Monica	I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
Monica	What?
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
Monica	And a baby...
Monica	We sure are.
Monica	(quickly) Not it!
Monica	Rachel, this is yours.
Monica	All right, everybody open them!
Monica	I know.
Monica	Enjoy!
Monica	Hey, let me tell them!
Monica	Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Monica	(stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
Monica	Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
Monica	Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
Monica	Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Monica	Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Monica	Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
Monica	(singing) "I'm a little bit country"...
Chandler	(to Monica) I'm leaving you.
Rachel	Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
Monica	(to Rachel) Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
Monica	Who is it?
Monica	What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)
Monica	Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
Monica	...If-you-say-so.
Roy	So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take (he shakes his hips) downtown! (Monica points Phoebe)
Monica	Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
Monica	Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
Phoebe	Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)
Monica	(walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
Monica	I can't believe we are at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!
Monica	Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
Monica	Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
Monica	I KNOW!
Rachel	Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).
Chandler	(smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?
Chandler	Hi Monica.
Monica	Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)
Monica	Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Monica	Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Monica	That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)
Monica	For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)
Monica	Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy)
Monica	She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Monica	What? When was this?
Monica	Oh my God! That's wild!
Monica	Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
Monica	(screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)
Monica	YES! (Chandler gets an "oh no!" look on his face)
Monica	I was the pile of coats!
Monica	You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Monica	You were my first kiss ever?
Monica	Oh, crap!
Monica	(she enters with a headset on and she's speaking into the microphone) Well, it matters to me!
Monica	Did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Monica	You don't know military time?
Monica	Just subtract twelve.
Monica	(screaming) Six o'clock!
Monica	Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Monica	Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Monica	Ooh... she backed out.
Monica	I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
Rachel	Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Monica	(coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)
Monica	(looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
Monica	Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
Monica	Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
Ross	I'll do it! (Monica approaches)
Monica	Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)
Monica	You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
Monica	(very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)
Phoebe	Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
Monica	oh God.
Phoebe	And... moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done.
Monica	What?
Phoebe	YOU'RE FIRED! (mimes the CUT again) (pause and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)
Monica	Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Monica	Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)
Monica	Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Monica	Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Monica	Hi.
Monica	She's in her room, why?
Monica	I know.
Monica	Bye.
Monica	(Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling) Uh! What a pickle.
Monica	(enjoying what she's seeing) How's it going?
Phoebe	(to Monica) Help me.
Monica	What?
Monica	(Sounds moved) Really?
Monica	You really want me to come back?
Monica	Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
Monica	Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
Monica	(Putting down her phone) Well, the club lost it's power.
Phoebe	Me too! (turning to Monica) Monica, do you think we could do it?
Monica	(thinking) AFFIRMATIVE!
Monica	(walking around with her headset still on) OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. (He does so and the lights above the chairs light up. Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)
Monica	Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
Monica	Really?
Monica	Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
Monica	Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me. (they walk off, Ross looks down to Chappy, who he's holding and he gets a whiff of the dog's smell. He is clearly disgusted by it.)
Monica	Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
Monica	So, you're ready to do this?
Monica	I love you. (Phoebe leans in to kiss her.) Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell. (the girls hug)
Rachel and Monica	I love you.
Monica	Okay. (in her microphone) It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. (to all) Let's get this bad boy on the road.
Chandler	(to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Monica	(checking her clipboard) I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Chandler	Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)
Monica	Okay Marjorie, hit it.
Monica	Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh, that's me.
Monica	Yeah, you really shouldn't. (to Ross, sarcastically) By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Monica	Hey.
Monica	I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Monica	Hey.
Monica	No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
Ross	So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)
Monica	Hey!
Monica	These are for Erica!
Monica	Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
Monica	Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
Monica	Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Monica	Honey.
Ross	I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Rachel	Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
Monica	(entering with Erica and Chandler) Hey you guys.
Monica	I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
Monica	Joey. Erica, baby!
Monica	Everyone. Erica, baby!
Chandler	Monica. Calm, self.
Chandler	Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.
Monica	Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
Monica	What is with you?
Monica	Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
Monica	Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Erica	Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)
Erica	Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)
Erica	Yeah... it's almost definitely him. (Monica and Chandler look confused now)
Monica	How's that now?
Erica	No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)
Monica	Was he falsely accused of something? (They look hopeful)
Erica	No... he killed his father with a shovel. (Monica and Chandler's jaws drop) But other than that, he's a great guy.
Monica	Are you awake?
Monica	Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
Monica	Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
Monica	How?
Monica	Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
Erica	(To Chandler) We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob (Monica smiles at Chandler and his he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife)
Erica	No! (To Monica) You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
Chandler	O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?
Monica	Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
Monica	(smiling) No it's not.
Monica	The thing we never do.
Monica	Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
Monica	Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
Monica	No one wanted seconds, right?
Monica	I don't know who I'm happiest for...
Monica	No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this. (pats Chandler on his leg)
Monica	Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Monica	I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
Monica	All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Monica	Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
Monica	See you guys later.
Monica	(to Joey) I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Phoebe	All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
Monica	Hey Pheebs.
Monica	Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
Monica	Phoebe!
Monica	You seriously changed your name to that?
Monica	Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Monica	Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Monica	But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Monica	Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Monica	Ah, so glad you decided to come.
Monica	No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Monica	Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
Monica	No it's not!
Monica	Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
Monica	Joey, we know that's you.
Joey	(frustrated) Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
Monica	Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Monica	Hey, where have you been?
Monica	Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
Chandler and Monica	No!
Monica	No.
Monica	I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Monica	So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
Monica	Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
Monica	Oh, sorry!
Chandler	My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
Joey	What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to Monica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
Monica	Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
Monica	I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Monica	How is that gonna happen?
Monica	You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
Monica	Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
Monica	But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Monica	That's terrible!
Phoebe	Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
Monica	Joey's gonna be 
Monica	Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
Monica	What if he reads it in the paper?
Monica	Thanks.
Monica	Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
Monica	Love it!
Monica	They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
Chandler (to Monica)	Sure.
Janice	Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! (does her irritating laugh). So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie (playfully punches Chandler, who tries to get away from her)
Monica	No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)
Chandler	(To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?
Monica	(looks confused and scared) I don't know why.
Janice	Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! (Chandler and Monica are utterly shocked) Ellen, we're going to talk numbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside)
Monica	Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Monica	(Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands) All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
Monica	Okay, you come up with an idea.
Monica	But we love our house.
Monica	Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking it pushing something up)
Chandler	(looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)
Janice	All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)
Chandler	Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
Monica	Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
Monica	Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
Monica	Ok, so you've done some good work! (pause) What about your carry-ons?
Monica	Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! (they hug)
Monica	Here, let me help you. (they both start opening boxes)
Monica	Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
Monica	You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
Monica (to Ross)	Okay, well, stop staring at them.
Monica	Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Monica	Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Monica	Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
Monica	Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
Monica	Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Monica	Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Monica	Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
Monica (enters the room)	Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
Monica	From?
Monica	All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
Ross	You got it! (Monica leaves, Ross closes the door). All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
Chandler	I didn't know Monica had these!
Monica	Hey! Where's Mike?
Monica	Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Monica	Yeah.
Monica	Come here, I'll make you a drink.
Monica	Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.
Monica	What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
Monica	That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Monica	Rachel used to live in that room.
Monica	Joey's bare ass!
Rachel	Ok. Monica?
Monica	Yeah?
Monica	Sure.
Phoebe	(to Monica) Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
Monica	No.
Phoebe	Oh, you're so screwed. (Monica goes into the guest room)
Monica	I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
Monica	(having the same problem) You're the best friend I ever had.
Monica	What?
Monica	That is so sweet. (they hug)
Ross	(to Joey) Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
Rachel	Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
Chandler	Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Monica	(to Ross) So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
Monica	You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Monica	Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Monica	Yeah. Mine too.
Monica	And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
Monica	I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Monica	Uh, where do you think you're going?
Monica	We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Monica	Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Monica	Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
Monica	Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
Monica	You did? How?
Monica	Oh my God! Let me see. (they all look at the pictures)
Chandler	Monica's grandmother.
Monica	Nana liked it rough!
Monica	Erica, are you okay?
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
Monica	All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh! (she's hyperventilating)
Monica	Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
Monica	Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
Monica	Erica, are you okay?
Monica	Oh my God!
Monica	She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
Monica	Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
Monica	No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
Monica	Alright, I'll be right back.
Monica	To use the bathroom.
Monica	What?
Monica	What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
Monica	You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
Joey	It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Joey	Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
Phoebe	Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! (Singing) "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."
Monica	It's just a little bit more, honey.
Monica	Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
Monica	Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
Monica	It's a... It's a boy!
Monica	Oh, you did it!
Monica	(to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on the verge of tears) Oh, we are so lucky!
Monica	(To Erica) Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
Monica	I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
Monica	We only ordered one!
Monica	(to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?
Monica	(to Erica) Anybody tell you?
Monica	This is unbelievable.
Chandler	Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?
Monica	What do you mean "what do we do"?
Monica	Chandler, you're panicking!
Monica	We can't split them up!
Monica	Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Monica	Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Chandler	Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Monica	That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
Monica	Okay!
Chandler	(To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor) And that's enough!
Monica	Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
Monica	There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
Monica	Son of a gun, it is!
Monica	Okay, well, bye!
Monica	We'll call you!
Monica	Oh, look at these little bunnies!
Monica	Okay.
Monica	Alright, let's see..
Monica	Yeah, I'm good.
Joey	Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Joey	(To Monica) Hey, so what is the big surprise?
Monica	Yes, it's twins!
Monica	(points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at the baby Chandler is holding) and that's a girl.
Monica	Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Monica	I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Monica	I love you.
Monica	Call us when you get there.
Monica	Now, that you can do.
Monica	Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
Monica	Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Monica	Oh God! What did I just step on?
Monica	Oh..
Monica	I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
Monica	Hello.
Monica	Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
Ross	Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Monica	Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
Monica	Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
Ross	Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Monica	Isn't that cute?
Monica	Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
Monica	That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
Monica	Newark airport. Why, where are you?
Monica	Hey! Did you find them?
Monica	Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
Monica	Alright. My job here is done.
Monica	Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
Monica	Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
Monica	I know.
Monica	I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
Monica	Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
Monica	If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Monica	Oh, yeah, that's true.
Monica	Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
Monica	Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Monica	(crying) This is harder than I thought it would be.
Monica	We got some time.
