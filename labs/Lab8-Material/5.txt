(to Carol and Susan)
(throws it in fire)
(she throws the directions in)
(tossing things in the fire)
(looking at picture)
(to Chandler)
(Ross is watching Carol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left stranded)
(Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)
(reluctantly)
(struggling)
(reading the candy)
(surprised)
(noticing Kristin's absence)
(He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.)

(rushing to explain)
(phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler)
(on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)
(excited)
(he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
(they look outside)
(walks away from window)
(sitting)
(he presses a button on his intercom)
(shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)

(whispers)
(from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)
(Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... (Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he finishes)
(he gets up and goes into the kitchen)
(from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, "You see!")
(joining him and taking the taco shells)
(looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)
(reaches for box)
(he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends down to pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.)
(he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.)
(childishly)
(she grabs for the package, and it breaks open. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears)
(furious)
(excited)
(to Ross)
(gestures with hands)
(on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened)
(presses down hard)
(presses down hard again)
(presses down elsewhere)
(she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in pain)
(She continues to work him over with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)
(Touched, she puts an arm around her friend and kisses her.)
(No longer touched)
(Like a big baby)
(Tapping the clipboard)
(Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her voice anyway)
(Getting up to go)
(Jumping up to make Rachel sit down)
(to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tiny laugh) these forms (tiny laugh)
(Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh)
(She hands over a blank form)
(Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am that stupid (tiny laugh)

(as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel can catch her)
(on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing "You are...")
(Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV)

(lying down on a mattress)
(hops onto the bed)
(proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you dont have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this.

(Ross groans and rubs his neck)
(goes to Monicas room)

(to Rachel)
(sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.)
(starts to go to a back room)
(makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin! (honks the beds little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)

(entering with Monica)
(patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet)
(to Joey)
(looking out the window)

Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what Im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay, Ive decided Im gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves)

(pause)
(on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye.

(entering)
(triumphantly)
(they start to leave)
(He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
(on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey is intrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys wont live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a little baby chick)

(Joey gives him a Like I would know look)
(she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)
(She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin)
(She picks up an aspirin between her toes) Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.)

(with a hurt expression on her face)
(He checks his watch)
(rushing in)
(She drops the brush)
(He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He doesnt like how it tastes.)
(taking the brush back) Okay. Lets use this brush. (Hands him another one.)
(He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she has a black eye.)

(starts to put on the sweater) Dont-dont switch or anything, cause Im, Im right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.) Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as Monica returns from the bathroom.)
(She turns on the speaker phone.)
(entering, carrying the chick and duck)

(Kate walks away depressed.) Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is (stops, reads it again, and throws down the paper in disgust) Thank you, boys and girls, youve ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mothers crab cakes! (starts to leave)
(to Monica)
(entering, drunk) I am hurt! (to Joey and Kate) A plague on both your houses! (walks away)

(points to the phone)
(noticing the chick) Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. (picks up the chick) Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? (starts to pet him) Aww. (The chick poops on his hand.) Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, Im so cute, Im a little chick whos disgusting! God, youre so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!!

(starts to walk out and stops) (to Rachel)
(yelling from onstage)
(to Lauren)
(sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, youve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so Im gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. But I wont have aged at all. (gets on the ladder)

(knocks on the door)
(takes the drawer back and replaces)
(motions to the table) Come on, have a seat. (looks at it)
(starts laughing as if that joke was funny, Ross only looks at him, and he stops)
(quickly wipes it off)
(Ross gives him a What? look)
(He starts moving his hands around in circles above the thing.)
(congratulates him)
(The lights turn on, once again theyre too bright.) Uh, romantic lights. (The lights dim.)

Would you--Give me this thing (grabs the napkin holder from her.) all right!! Enough! (to Billy) And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! (gets up to leave) Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! (Billy follows him)
(they both leave)
(pause)

(Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.)
(laughs)
(Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her plate.)
(on the phone) Monica, Im quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didnt even buy it! (Pause) Im telling you Im quitting! Thats it! Im talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.)

(He starts to leave)
(He goes out the door.)
(coming back in)
(He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr. Waltham returns.)
(opening the door)
(Notices a pair of mens pants on the chair.)
(entering)
(to Joey)
(She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.)
(holding a lure)
(laughs and picks up another lure)
(laughs harder)
(not wanting to be left out, picks up something)
(examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the sandwich)
(pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Gellers got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) Its the classic struggle between man and(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.)

(Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at his ass.)
(turning around)
(Grabs his hand.) Youre aboutwell uh, this one is large. And this one(Grabs the other hand.)
(entering)
(motions to Joshua.)
(Holds out his hands as to say, "Where are my gloves?")

(rushing in)
(He gets a whiff of Joey and starts smelling around.)
(trying to act like hes not the one that stinks.)

(No, not the Cigarette Smoking Man from The X-Files.)
(He leaves.)
(getting up and sliding a One into the dancers hot pants)
(doing the same)
(joining them)
(to the waitress)
(Motions for one.)
(He opens to curtain to reveal a naked and wet Joey.)
(shocked)
(tosses him a towel, motions for him to get out of the shower and sits down on the couch) Every actor at one time or anotheropp! (Joey tries to sit down next to him and Heston makes him sit somewhere else.)

(Yep, you guessed it. Its Janice.)
(Shrugs)
(entering, with Janice in tow)
(Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)
(Does the now famous laugh.)
(to Chandler)
(Finally closes the door on her.) (After its closed) I cant stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)
(Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
(standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I dont have to break up with her this time. Were not involved! Im going to do a pre-emptive strike! Im going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)
(They all look around and then back at Joey.)

(laughs)
(Pause)
(Gasps)
(Thinks)

(Reaches into the shower again.)

(starts rubbing her belly)
(angered by the rubbing)
(coming in from a changing room)
(He tries on the coat.)
(He goes to put his hands in his pockets.)

(She goes over and retrieves her note.)
(noticing her)
(Shows her the real anti-theft device.)
(Rips up the note.)
(Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said hes not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)
(entering)
(Points to the living room.)
(Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.)
(Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy smoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)
(interrupting Monica and Emily)
(He squeezes Monicas knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)
(He goes over to her.)
(with her coat on, shes leaving with Ross)
(spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunthers face and decides not to kiss him.)
(They both kiss.)
(They kiss again.)
(stopping them)
(He walks away, giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)
(He grabs two steaks from the freezer)
(pause)
(Runs into the living room)
(She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) EmilWhoa!! (She falls in Chandlers room.) Okay! So thats me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunthers the only one that claps.)
(She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.)
(She glares at him.)
(trying not to be obvious)
(She makes a decision.) Yknow, this bra Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Yknow, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, yknow what theyd say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isnt co-operating.)
(Sits down heavily on the bed.)
(He turns around)
(Sits down next to her.)
(He starts to go inside and stops.)
(He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)
(He has just returned.)
(Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.)
(He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.)
(coming in from his bedroom)
(Stops and thinks about what he just said.)
(coming in from the bathroom)
(Exits.)
(to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)
(She makes a move for the remote.)
(entering, carrying her massage table)
(She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)
(She goes over and stands in front of the TV.)

(Thinks about it.)
(In a British accent.)
(interrupting him)

(Shes shocked and hugs him.) Thank you. (She boards the plane.)
(As she exits, Phoebe enters.)
(Points to Chandler)
(Pause)
(Tries to push Ross out the door.)
(entering carrying a case)
(She opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.)
(Answers the phone.)
(Points to the TV.)
(Chandler nods his head no.)
(interrupting)
(on phone)
(pause)
(Points at Chandler) I was right! (Points to Emily)
(Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.)
(yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! Im, Im gonna call you right now from the phone booth! (Realises) You cant hear me. (Goes to make his call.)
(Answers the call waiting.)
(not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.)
(She starts to play and sing.)
(entering)
(laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.)
(To Phoebe)
(Leaves)

(Goes over and comforts him.)
(They kiss.)
(taking a bite)
(sees the chick and the duck)
(getting up and backing away from they.)
(answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings them inside.)
(She sees that Joshua isnt relaxed.)
(opening the door.)
(We see Ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)
(She goes over and shakes their hands.)
(She grabs a pen and paper)
(He heads for his bedroom.)
(Phoebe and Monica nod there heads in agreement.)
(returning from the phone.)
(They all look at her.)
(entering)
(To Joey)
(pleased)
(She grabs her coat and runs out.)
(Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby Chandler.)

(Starts singing)
(Starts singing)
(Shakes his head around, pretending like hes jamming.)
(She puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)
(entering, wearing Santa pants)
(Phoebe still doesnt get it.)
(Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists whos been naughty and whos been nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.)

(Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (Jumping up.)
(Slams the door shut.)
(Slams the door shut.)
(opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.)
(Its not really a scarf, its just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)
(turning around.)
(Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for Rachels reaction.) I think its great! (Hugs Ross.)
(to Ross)
(They hug again.)

(answering for him)
(waking Joey)
(sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly)
(He goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.)
(asleep)
(catching it) I got it! Mine! (They both hug)
(Gets into position)
(cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual)
(Phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)
(upset)
(Finally realises)
(entering)
(Theyre stunned.)

(goes to the door) lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)
(Ross is standing in the doorway.)
(Hes frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)
(She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door)
(seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
(opening the door)
(taking apart the invitation)
(entering)

(They all look at him)
(entering)
(They all try and hide their invitations.)

(stuttering incoherently)
(seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.)
(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.)
(Rachel grabs the phone and hangs it up for him.)
(on phone) Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (She hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket.)

(Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and Rachel moves to comfort her.)
(entering)
(Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.)
(She shows Rachel what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies.)
(Its a little pink and white dress for the girl baby.)
(banging a spoon against his beer bottle)
(to Ross) Thanks for not marrying Rachel. (He starts to leave.)
(He gives Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)
(Its a shirt that reads, "Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998")
(Shows him whats on the back, "Best Man Joey Tribbiani, with a huge picture of him.)
(banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the stripper)
(Chandler checks and runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.)
(Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)
(The museum geeks exit and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.)
(The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck complies.)
(realises he doesnt know her name.) stripper! (He notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees its empty and starts to panic.)
(running and banging on Chandlers door)
(opening the door)
(Shrugs.)
(Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebes way.)
(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)
(starting to cry)
(Rachel starts crying harder.)
(entering)
(Gives Joey a little squeeze.)
(laughs, softly)
(dialling the phone)
(They give it to her and quickly take a step back.)

(Points to Monica.)
(Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.)
(to Ross)
(to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)
(Sees Joey.)
(Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
(Chandler) didnt take it, then who did? (The duck quacks.) Shh! Were trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at Joey, who doesnt get it. After a short pause, with the duck still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)
(They all hug.)
(coming in from surgery)
(He grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where its been.)
(Chandler)
(They all start getting emotional.)
(starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so that they cant see him cry.)

(entering, with Phoebes book.)
(laughs)
(She pats him on his head.)
(And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)
(Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map of London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)
(Points to the map.) Wait. No, we wanna go No. I know. (Sets the map down.) Im gonna have to go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)
(Picks up the map and starts walking.)
(Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)
(Gives her the time-out signal.)
(Ross pushes her.)
(She stops suddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.)
(She starts running towards the building.)
(running in, with Ross)

(Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the front of it.)
(He pays for the hat.)
(looks around)
(Puts the hat on.)
(He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)
(He puts his pants on backwards.)
(Holds out his pants)
(She throws them on the floor.)
(He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)
(She storms out.)
(chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please(He catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)
(depressed)
(She gathers up all of these things.)
(Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it out of her hand.)

(to another female nurse)
(He starts rocking back and forth, taking Ross with him.)

(points to Gary Collins.)
(As he is speaking, Joey and the volunteer getting into a shoving match.) and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do (Joey is knocked down.) is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to (Just as the volunteer sits down, Joey pulls him to the ground.)
(entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and starts shaking a)
(There are none.) Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the answer.)
(She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex tonight? (Reads the answer.)
(in an unenthusiastic voice)
(on phone)
(on TV.) It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers(He walks over to where Joey is sitting.) Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, (Joey stands up.)
(Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)
(entering)
(She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.)
(She starts to take off her latex gloves.)
(She takes them off.)
(entering)
(The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.)
(answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. (Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not knowing what's going on.)

(Phoebe pinches him.)
(Phoebe pinches him again.)
(proud of herself)
(Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.)

(Closes the door.)
(glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)
(entering)
(Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)

(To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go! (He runs off.) (To Larry)
(Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.)
(grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.)
(turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm, what's this? (Points to his plate.)
(Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and what-what's this? (Points again.)
(upon seeing Rachel she points)
(He heads off.)
(To Monica)
(returning, with a friend) Rachel, this is my friend Tom. (To Tom)
(Leaves.)
(laughs)
(getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)
(Points to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his door.)
(Does the 'quiet down' maneuver)
(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress)
(He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.)
(Note: Actually, I think every guy is thankful for thongs. That and spandex. J )
(And he makes eyes at him.)
(muffled)
(surprised)
(He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)

(Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)
(pointing)
(turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are! (Starts dancing.)
(laughing)
(She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.)
(Walks into the living room and greets Monica's parents.)
(entering)
(Wanting to be introduced.)
(seeing her)

(entering)
(He starts to show her as the doorbell rings.)
(Runs out.)
(To his parents)
(To Chandler)
(They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
(She turns around making sure he gets a good look.)
(entering)
(She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.)
(excited)
(To Chandler) Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)
(She goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.)
(She picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)
(She drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)
(She takes a bag of ice out of her purse and hands it to the doctor.)
(opening it) Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and(Stops suddenly.)
(He storms out.)
(Follows him out.)
(To Joey)
(He goes into his apartment.)
(She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
(She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
(She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
(He tries to think of another but can't)
(taking something out of the couch)
(Pause as he thinks about it.)
(waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of the way.)
(reluctantly taking them)
(Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's room.)
(entering)
(To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)

(Notices something.) What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God! (As she storms out, Rachel returns and overhears the conversation.)
(She storms away and Rachel enters to confront Joey.)
(Looks around the room.) You were actually gonna (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (Rachel stares in shock.)
(Points at Chandler, angrily.)
(Thinks)
(Starts for his room.)
(Proudly)
(laughs)
(laughs)
(getting upset)
(getting angry)
(jumping to his feet in anger)
(trying to remain in control)
(losing control, we hear him shout outside)
(Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
(sitting down)
(entering)
(Hands him a Polaroid.)
(gasps)
(in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.)
(entering, angrily)
(smiling)
(yelling and waving her hand in the air)
(sees the picture)
(entering, with the rest of the gang)
(Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
(Shows Ross the picture.)
(covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the gang.)
(grabbing the picture)
(He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading with Joey to go along with it.)
(thinking)
(Takes another pill.)
(Pause)
(Offers it to everyone.)
(entering, happily)
(Running out)
(She puts more money in the bucket.)
(She pours out the rest of her change purse into the bucket.)
(She waves her arm and spreads her joy.)
(The man storms off.)
(She scowls at him.)
(grabbing a notepad and sitting down)
(disappointed)
(jumping up)
(He punches his fist through the wall next to the door.)
(The lady ignores her and walks off.)
(The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that. (She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.)
(Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! (Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.)
(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluidOp! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
(To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. (To Joey)
(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the burn spots on his oven mitts.)
(Danny nods, "Yes.")
(Hits him softly.)
(Hits her back.)
(Hits him softly.)
(Hits her back.)
(Hits him softly.)
(Hits her back.)
(Hits him harder this time.)
(not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue to ignore her.)
(Hands it to Monica.)
(Throws the bucket down.)
(Leaves.)
(entering from her room)
(laughing with Ross)
(They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start wrestling.)
(She leaves them to wrestle.)
(entering from his bedroom)
(To Chandler)
(To Ross)
(He rips up the tickets.)
(Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
(His sister)
(A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (She takes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does it again. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of it and some filling falls into his lap.)
(She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. The thing that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to his crotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)
(To Rachel)
(To the gang.)
(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the lint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)
(The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.)
(She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.) (The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. (The old lady.)
(calling from the bathroom)
(seeing Rachel's shocked look)
(Gets up and runs from the apartment.)
(entering)
(Pause)
(Takes a copy.)
(Takes another copy.)
(Reading.) "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross (Points to him.)
(Pauses and looks at Joey.)
(Looks at Joey.)
(Stops reading.) All right Joey, we get it. (To Chandler)
(To Ross)
(reading from the script.)
(Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler)
(Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.)
(Reading the scene set up.)
(deadpan, standing next to Monica)
(hopping)
(watching the ball drop)
(To Monica)
(To Phoebe)
(To Joey)
(Ross looks at him.)
(She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.)
(Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name and phone number on it.)
(reading it)
(Sits down rubbing his temple.)
(Chandler is straining to keep quiet as Phoebe enters.)
(Talking into Chandler's ear.)
(To Chandler)
(Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the guitar.)
(She starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note: For this one you'll have to use your imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see them, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)
(Goes into her room.)
(Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's chords.)
(They both laugh at what she said.)
(He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings. Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.)
(entering, with Ben)
(He runs to hug her.)
(notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.)
(Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)
(Motions to Ross's buttock.)
(To Chandler)
(Storms out.)
(after he's left)
(Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and Monica.)
(Does a chord and Monica starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)
(talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.)
(Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another word he heads into her bathroom.)
(in ecstasy)
(yelling from outside)
(Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.)
(thinks) (quietly)
(Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.)
(Notices Monica standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)
(Leaves.)
(looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! (Storms out.)
(entering, singing)
(Storms out.)
(on phone)
(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
(on phone)
(She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
(answering phone)
(calling from Elizabeth's bathroom)
(Grabs some of her shelf.)
(He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.)
(entering)
(To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)
(Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his current state.)
(After a short pause she hands him her guitar.)
(He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note. However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)
(sitting back down)
(Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
(Shows him Ben's picture.)
(Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)
(Smells it.)
(She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)
(Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling his fingers out of his ears.)
(quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.)
(Note: Kudos to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of that line. She said it very quickly and didn't screw up a word. Try it yourself, it ain't that easy.)
(gasps)
(Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)
(Pause.)
(entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and sighs in relief.)
(She sits next to him on the couch.)
(thinks)
(thinks)
(disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? (To the gang.)
(He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.)
(eyeing the flattened scone)
(He takes her hand.)
(She kisses him on the cheek.)
(Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica)
(Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.)
(Slaps Chandler on his butt.)
(They walk off leaving Chandler and Monica alone.)
(She glares at him.)
(He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.)
(Exits.)
(To Monica)
(checks watch)
(Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.)
(gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.)
(entering from the bathroom)
(Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.)
(The duck quacks.)
(entering from his room)
(licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.)
(To his wife.)
(out of breath and mouths)
(Does his work laugh.) (To Monica)
(She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and Kara and scores a point.)
(Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
(Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)
(Mocks the fake laugh.)
(She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.)
(snaps his fingers)
(entering) Ross you left you scarf in(sees everyone.) Hey you guys. (Does the laugh.)
(They all turn and look at Ross.)
(To Ross) You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! (Does her famous, or is that infamous, laugh and exits.)
(entering)
(Thinks)
(Does her fake laugh.)
(He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
(entering)
(Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.)
(turning from Ross.)
(Chandler does the laugh.)
(Once again, with the laugh.)
(To Chandler)
(Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
(entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not laugh.)
(interrupting)
(They all laugh.)
(Does the laugh again.)
(entering)
(from his bedroom)
(entering)
(Pause.)
(Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and is almost in tears.)
(Serves them both some coffee.)
(starting to cry)
(Janice makes an agreeing sound.)
(Laughs and exits.)
(He laughs, his real laugh this time.)
(realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him)
(counts his money)
(walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee)
(He picks a hat up from the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)
(examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)
(glaring at Joey)
(Pause)
(entering, in a hurry)
(to the guys)
(Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)
(Shows him.)
(He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.)
(Opens the door.) (Disappointed)
(Starts to leave.)
(entering)
(Removes a sandwich and starts eating.)
(He's holding the fake credit cards that come with the bag.)
(glaring at him)
(Smiles provocatively.)
(notices his bag.)
(He pulls them out of the bag.)
(Seeing the look on her face)
(Whispers)
(Hands back his glasses and hurries out.)
(approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me. (Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap him in his face.)
(They stare at her, dumbfounded)
(entering, with bag)
(pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)
(Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" (Calming down.)
(indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She starts giving Chandler a massage.)
(seeing the look on Chandler's face)
(wincing)
(Pauses after she realizes what she's saying.)
(reading from the script)
(stopping him)
(He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new here. Maybe we shouldI'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a question.)
(Does so.)
(As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the bag.)
(coming all the way in)
(falling into that trap)
(starting to cry)
(bursting into tears)
(They hug.)
(He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on the arm of the couch.)
(looking in her purse)
(opens it)
(She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1)
(Quickly shows him.)
(Gets up to leave.) But umm Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please? (Hands her a note.)
(He looks up in shock.)
(pause)
(Sits down next to her and brushes against her leg.) Oops. (He backs up.)
(Singing.)
(Backs away.)
(Moves over and takes his hand.)
(Drops his hand and moves back.)
(dejected)
(Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)
(Pause)
(She's avoiding his eyes.)
(Looks for help.)
(Ross nods in agreement as well.)
(Pause)
(looking out the window)
(laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)
(Does so.)
(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.)
(screaming)
(entering)
(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)
(Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)
(entering)
(Glares at Rachel.)
(Joey gasps)
(To Rachel)
(Joey shies away.)
(To Phoebe)
(entering)
(feels his arm)
(Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.)
(She runs to her room and returns carrying a huge bag of laundry.)
(She holds up a bag of quarters.)
(entering)
(They all head to the window."	tip the scales in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the window. (They all head to the window.)
(Exits.)
(She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
(after they've left)
(a little hurt)
(entering)
(To Ross)
(He opens the door and stops.)
(Exits.)
(Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To Phoebe)
(in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.)
(He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
(Hangs up.)
(She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.)
(Joey just shakes his head.)
(He claps his hands.)
(in the kitchen with Chandler)
(laughs)
(initially worried, but gets over it)
(looking out the window)
(She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's shoulder.)
(She runs to get some.)
(He begrudgingly does so.)
(Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)
(handing her the wine)
(She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)
(She goes for another one.)
(They go inside and he closes the door.)
(She starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)
(swallowing hard)
(He does a little mimic of her dance.)
(entering the hall)
(To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
(Examining the dress.)
(Pause)
(She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.)
(swallowing hard)
(Pause)
(They walk together and hug.)
(They kiss.)
(Pause)
(She turns and buttons up.)
(He notices something through the window.) No! Wh What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.)
(He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.)
(To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)
(They go to the door. Ross is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.)
(running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow)
(panicking)
(To Chandler)
(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) (To Joey and Rachel)
(Joey and Rachel backup against the door.)
(happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? (He hugs them both.)
(Ross turns and glares at him.)
(interrupting)
(quickly)
(to her)
(Points.)
(She hits him repeatedly as she says that.)
(shyly)
(Quietly)
(She takes his hand.)
(opens it to reveal Phoebe)
(Points to his apartment across the hall.)
(Starts to leave.)
(Exits.)
(To Phoebe)
(To Rachel)
(Exits.)
(She slaps her thighs, Joey jerks, and spills some of his coffee.)
(sets the coffee down)
(She punches him again and he retreats to the arm of the couch.)
(She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of the couch.)
(His eyes snap open.)
(Gets up.)
(She storms out.)
(Looks at Chandler)
(Goes to talk to her.)
(She walks out.)
(He grabs her arm to get her attention.)
(A guest walks up to her.)
(walking up)
(Walks away.)
(entering)
(She punches Rachel like she punched Joey.)
(Joey motions, "You see what I mean?!")
(Punches Joey) are too much! (Punches Rachel.)
(Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)
(She punches Rachel.)
(She retaliates.)
(Punches Rachel yet again.)
(She kicks Katie in the shin.)
(trying to get her attention)
(ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying. (Laughs.)
(tapping her on the shoulder)
(Turns to him.)
(He cuts himself a piece of cake.)
(trying a piece of cake)
(sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross tries dumping it into a nearby plant.)
(Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy)
(raising her hand)
(He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
(getting out a ring box)
(She doesn't move.)
(Laughs.)
(kneels with him)
(Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)
(Points at the door.)
(Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)
(thinks)
(To Monica)
(checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)
(looking at the bill)
(She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel! (Donates it.)
(Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.)
(No one laughs.)
(She crosses her fingers in hope.)
(entering)
(To Monica)
(Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the bathroom.)
(disgusted at Ross's antics)
(To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hovering nearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, (In a sexy voice)
(Hands him a clipboard.)
(He signs the form and hands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the couch.)
(She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting her to help.) (Laughing.)
(Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her amazement, she is successful.)
(He starts backing out of the store.)
(Laughs.) Something didn't quite add up there. (Ross stops, walks back to talk to the salesman, and in the process pushes Rachel up against a wall.)
(To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman)
(To the salesman)
(Turns away)
(Grabs the badge)
(To no one in particular.)
(The woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular)
(Throws off the last cushion.)
(The bottom of the couch is hitting the railing.)
(She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.)
(Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. (Flashes the badge.)
(cooking something)
(Flashes the badge and they glare at her.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for the door just as Joey enters.)
(To Joey)
(To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.)
(Holds out a spoon for him.)
(backing away)
(pause) but I don't want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)
(Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.)
(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)
(looks at her)
(Looking at Chandler and slowly realizing what his point is.)
(entering)
(laughing)
(noticing him)
(in a sexy voice)
(Shows the badge.)
(he reaches into the car and slams his siren on the roof.)
(Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. (Tries to leave.)
(stopping her)
(starts to walk away, but stops)
(Starts walking off.)
(following her) Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. (Phoebe's stunned)
(She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs away.)
(In a sexy voice)
(laughing)
(Pulls out a chair for her.)
(laughs and pushes the chair back in)
(Pause)
(entering)
(entering)
(Showing them) Okay Rach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.)
(Points.)
(looking at the sketch)
(They start up the stairs. Ross is first.)
(straining)
(They start up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.)
(entering)
(Starts for his room.)
(stopping him)
(To Rachel)
(Pause)
(entering)
(taking a bite)
(Points at all of them) with me. (They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.)
(He starts to leave.)
(To Rachel)
(Ross nods yes.)
(thinks)
(Gets up to join them.)
(They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)
(To Monica)
(waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.) (Joey sees how beautiful she is.)
(He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.)
(joining him)
(Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica away and makes a disgusted face.)
(He pretends he's surfing by the window.)
(Runs away.)
(Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on his remote.)
(They kiss.)
(Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up)
(Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica)
(entering)
(She goes over and kisses him passionately.)
(She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not amused.)
(We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh (The flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.)
(entering from the bathroom)
(Chandler makes a noise)
(She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.)
(He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. (He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)
(He heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)
(Joey just stares at him)
(Looking around)
(He walks away and knocks on the next door which is answered by a little girl.)
(He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.)
(Sees that she has some ink on her lip from her pen.) Oh Rachel, uhh (He points to his lip to get her to notice the ink on hers.)
(He points again.)
(He goes to wipe it off himself.)
(stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.)
(entering)
(Realizes.)
(To Gary)
(He gestures and spills some of his coffee.)
(That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!)
(She gets up and walks over to Chandler.)
(They walk away to get some privacy.)
(to the woman checking her mail next to him)
(To Ross) Excuse me. (He puts up a flyer that has a sketch drawing of Joey and it reads, "Warning! Intruder! If you see this creep - call the cops!")
(to the woman checking her mail)
(Goes back to his mailbox.)
(makes some kind of crazy noise)
(Hands him a business card.)
(Starts to walk away.)
(Ross quickly hides the card in his mouth.)
(entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'? (Has a silly grin.)
(looking out the window)
(He looks out the window.)
(Pointing out the window.)
(Points)
(Starts to leave)
(There's a knock on the door.)
(He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.)
(Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)
(looks around for the camera)
(She puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause)
(gasps)
(She goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch thatI mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you soHey! I'll see you Monday! (Exits.)
(He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)
(laughs)
(Gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)
(Pause)
(gasps)
(Kisses her.)
(They hug.)
(Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.)
(laughs)
(entering)
(from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robot and waves at the cutouts.)
(He picks the 9 of Spades)
(Pause)
(holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)
(pause)
(entering with Ben and Ross)
(sets Ben down)
(reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! (Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.)
(entering from her room)
(Rachel exits.)
(from the bathroom)
(Monica nods in agreement.)
(Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved)
(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of Variety to read)
(Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)
(He winks at Carol.)
(On the other one.)
(laughing nervously)
(at the door)
(stops and tries to change directions)
(entering)
(She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)
(Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)
(Thinks)
(Thinks of something)
(entering, downtrodden)
(sadly) "Audition didn't go so well. (Happily)
(Pause)
(also downtrodden)
(Happily)
(Someone exhales and Rachel turns and coughs.)
(They walk away.)
(He holds up his pack.) Y'know what, actually (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim are standing and laughing.)
(Laughs)
(entering)
(To the people who didn't make it.)
(Points to Joey and Raymond) or you two. (Points to Kyle and Ben.) (Exits.)
(entering, carrying two garbage bags)
(She goes and opens the door to Joey.)
(To the guys)
(shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)
(To Rachel)
(She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)
(He sniffs her shoulder.)
(She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)
(Laughs)
(Mimics chain smoking.)
(She grabs their cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)
(Rachel laughs.)
(She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's lighter.)
(Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a little caveman thrown in.)
(Exits.)
(goes over to Ben)
(entering, angrily)
(angrily)
(angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.)
(entering)
(Some dude puts down a couple bowls of soup in front of them.)
(She looks at him until he gets it.)
(Pause.)
(Eats another spoonful) Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)
(Starts to walk away.)
(to Nancy)
(hearing that)
(To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)
(overhearing that)
(following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.)
(Monica glares at him.)
(Points)
(Runs to the snow cone machine.)
(noticing her)
(Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
(Nods his head in disgust.)
(pause)
(Thinks about it.)
(to Kim and Nancy)
(to Nancy) So we talked about the (Chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette) whole presentation yesterday at lunch (Closer) and he wondered if one person would be enough (Closer) to get a take on the trip (Still closer) and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!" (She's interrupted by Chandler who has reached his goal and takes a drag from her cancer stick.)
(Exits.)
(Hands her the money.)
(laughs)
(Makes some whiney, nasally noises.)
(Starts to move towards Ross.)
(backing away)
(looking through the pizzas)
(entering, with his grandmother)
(She just stares at him.)
(entering from the bathroom)
(They kiss.)
(Points)
(runs over to Phoebe)
(Walks over to Rachel)
(Goes to her room.)
(See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we could really tell.)
(She enters and hands Phoebe the earring)
(noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch)
(Runs over and opens the door.)
(I can't make it out.)
(Hands her the money.)
(Walks away and Ross closes the door.)
(To Monica)
(starts to laugh, but then gets serious)
(walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)
(Mumbles)
(To Chandler)
(entering from Rachel's bedroom)
(They have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.)
(smiling)
(smiling)

(not smiling)
(smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all smile.)
(smiling)
(smiling)
(Something in Italian to Joey.)
(Points to the screen, of course it isn't him.)
(pointing at the screen)
(following her)
(Walks away over to Rachel.)
(Goes to the door.)
(To Phoebe)
(she just looks at him)
(Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.)
(To Ross in the kitchen)
(checks his watch)
(Thinks)
(dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs out before anyone can stop him.)
(Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.)
(entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering)
(Puts 'em on.)
(Gives back the sunglasses.)
(entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.)
(To Rachel)
(shocked)
(They hug.)
(Holds out her arms for a hug.)
(angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel looks over at Phoebe in resignation.)
(Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)
(from outside)
(running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone)
(Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)
(Ross interrupts and shushes her.)
(Readies himself.)
(He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)
(gets the money)
(To Monica)
(to Caitlin)
(wanting more than anything to get the money and leave this horrible, horrible place)
(getting more desperate to leave)
(Runs for her life.)
(To All)
(Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)
(She grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)
(walking over to Ross)
(Stops Caitlin)
(entering)
(Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)
(entering)
(says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)
(on the tape)
(on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't get it, (pause, picks up the duck)
(on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)
(To Phoebe)
(Starts with that Italian stuff again.)
(singing)
(to his grandmother)
(To Monica)
(looking at them)
(To Ross)
(sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. (Joey panics.)
(Points behind Ross.)
(turning and looking)
(to the rest of the gang)
(entering, with Gary)
(Hands her the photo.)
(to Gary)
(to Gary)
(laughing) Okay. (Deadpan)
(returning from a deli)
(dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler)
(leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich)
(Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.)
(She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)
(on the answering machine)
(on answering machine) Hello Ross? It's Emily. (Rachel runs back into the room with the tequila.)
(Takes a slug of tequila.)
(To Gary)
(He drops the cherry and it turns on.)
(Tries to turn it off.)
(He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there flashing through his shirt)
(on answering machine)
(does Rachel's)
(does Monica's)
(Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.)
(She hits a button on the machine.)
(handing back a clipboard)
(deadpan)
(Joey slowly moves off of Ross.)
(To Ross)
(She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)
(on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)
(excited)
(He goes over to Phoebe and gives her a kiss.) (To Phoebe)
(To Ross)
(pouting)
(He gets up and starts for the door.)
(returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
(To Phoebe)
(Gets up)
(Goes and picks up the sandwich)
(He unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for Chandler)
(He grabs the sandwich.)
(with his mouthful)
(Goes to take another bite.)
(Takes back the sandwich.)
(He goes over and hugs her.)
(gasps)
(Rachel suddenly calms down)
(stares at her briefly)
(He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause)
(She starts for the door.) (Stops)
(Pause) (Not believing it)
(laughing)
(They hug.)
(Gets up.)
(on machine) "Hey Ross, it's you!" (Hits the stop button)
(She heads for the door again.)
(looking at the coffee table where his money was)
(going out the door)
(Points at Ross who points back.)
(Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey)
(To Phoebe)
(To Monica)
(Chandler nods in agreement.)
(shocked)
(To Phoebe) I'll see you after work sweetie. (Kisses her.)
(sitting down)
(terrified)
(Breathes a sigh of relief)
(She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)
(To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)
(he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief)
(looks at his watch)
(Checks his pants.)
(entering)
(She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross stares in shock.)
(They both glare at her.)
(To Joey)
(catches the ball)
(Looks at the ball in his hands.)
(Laughs at his joke.)
(laughs, then suddenly serious)
(pause)
(entering)
(Goes to the counter)
(Looks to Ross.)
(on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up and keeps throwing the ball.)
(Rachel's arms are covered with scratches.)
(shocked)
(To Rachel)
(Pause)
(Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler)
(To Phoebe) Hi sweetie. (Kisses her.)
(They move to the couch.)
(They sit down.)
(She stays still for a brief second.)
(disappointed)
(disappointed more)
(on the verge of tears)
(suddenly happy)
(They hug.) I'm sohappy. (She's not happy.)
(catching the ball)
(He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)
(jumping in front of him)
(He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)
(Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)
(she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand)
(Storms out.)
(Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.)
(Turns away from him.)
(Closes the door and takes off his coat.)
(sits down)
(Pause)
(produces one from the other chair) and uh, these are the listings I found. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights, (points)
(looks at the paper)
(Phoebe looks down in shame.) No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. (Points to his eyes and she does so)
(Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)
(Hugs him.)
(Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, (sees the look on his face)
(A woman approaches.)
(looks into the box)
(Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.)
(laughs)
(Good for her)
(Starts to leave.)
(makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled) Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her again, it sounds like Rachel)
(Ross and him)
(Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys all stop and stare at her)
(Pause)
(entering with the cat)
(Hands over the pillow.)
(Turns and walks away.)
(To Ross)
(Looks out the window) Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window)
(He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.)
(entering)
(He throws her the ball.)
(catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on the table and everyone gasps.)
(They all get up, thus officially ending the game.)
(Runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)
(Points at Chandler.)
(We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)
(To Rachel)
(He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)
(flinches)
(And on the "I" part she mimics poking her eye.)
(flinches again)
(Pokes his eye)
(freaks)
(Oh, you get the point by now.)
(Yeah, he does the same thing.)
(Exits.)
(after he's gone)
(entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. (Pause, then very excitedly)
(To Chandler)
(To Monica)
(Quietly)
(entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! (She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through the mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.})
(She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)
(quickly)
(Quickly)
(entering)
(She ignores him.)
(She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a table previously.)
(looks at it more closely)
(She does so.)
(jerks back from the tester)
(Rachel jerks back on 3.)
(Puts her head back.)
(She flinches on 2 this time.)
(Monica backs off.)
(She flinches again.) (Gives up.)
(really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.)
(Grabs them and storms out.)
(She covers her right eye and reads from the chart)
(She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.) (To Rachel)
(entering)
(Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
(entering)
(Walks out.)
(Runs after him.)
(Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away) Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He grabs the magazine away from her.)
(Gets up.)
(quietly)
(Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly looks at the road.)
(Pulls out the twenty)
(shocked)
(Realizes)
(He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound of numerous car horns.)
(Gets out and Joey speeds away.)
(Does the fist thing.)
(Points at his eye.)
(entering)
(Looks into the bag.)
(She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only problem is, it's not over her eye.)
(They sit down on the couch.)
(No they're not.)
(She's not holding any up.)
(thinks)
(Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the eyedropper.)
(She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by her legs.)
(as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)
(Rachel rolled onto her stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm I am going to get these drops in your eyes. (She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.)
(spitting out the eyedropper)
(Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqu pose, at least for primetime TV.)
(Thinks)
(answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's proud of herself.) (To Joey)
(on a pay phone holding a box)
(She hands the phone to Phoebe.)
(Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)
(who has just entered)
(We hear the dial tone as Joey hangs up.)
(Pause)
(entering)
(Realizes)
(laughs)
(Gets into his car.) Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay? (The car peels away.)
(He hands him a bunch of helium balloons.)
(The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.)
(answering it)
(on phone from Vegas)
(to the family)
(The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.)
(She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone climbs off of Rachel.)
(She's trying to recover while still on the floor.)
(smiles) Okay! (Goes to answer the phone.)
(under her breath)
(answering the phone) Hello? (Listens)
(entering)
(to Joey)
(To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes)
(She nods no to Chandler)
(To Phoebe)
(She hands the phone to Chandler.)
(To Joey)
(To Joey)
(Hangs up the phone and poses for that picture.)
(Starts looking around for her) Monica? (Goes into Monica's bedroom.)
(entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room)
(saddened)
(entering)
(Hands it too him.)
(grabbing the gift from him and opening it)
(They kiss)
(His and Monica's)
(entering with Ross)
(coughing)
(Picks up the phone and does so)
(Hands them each one from her purse.)
(takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. (Gets up and heads aft.)
(To Monica)
(He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.)
(sitting down)
(To Monica under her breath)
(talking out of the side of his mouth)
(He still ain't happy.)
(takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her head.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchennaked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does so) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)
(in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. (Looks back at his book.)
(singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! (There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's leaning against the door jam.)
(Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.) This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)
(Hisses at her.)
(laughs)
(gasps)
(Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other one and heads for the door.)
(Starts to leave)
(Catches up to them.)
(Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.)
(They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.) Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)
(To no one in particular)
(Points to an old woman standing behind him. Who glares at him and walks off.)
(To Chandler)
(They hug.)
(pushing her away from another hug)
(Walks away.)
(taking off her sweater)
(sarcastic)
(loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)
(interrupting in the nick of time)
(Mimics it.)
(to the bartender)
(Monica turns and stares at her.)
(Gets up to find Chandler.)
(When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling)
(Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes her head no.)
(Monica does so.) Dice are out. (The woman next to Monica rolls the dice.) Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! (Monica won and doubled the chip.)
(To Rachel) So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom. (Ross giggles.)
(to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)
(to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants would be dry.)
(to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.)
(Gives him the change.)
(betting all 100)
(Deals the cards)
(He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his hand next to the dealer's hand.)
(totally confused)
(pause)
(totally confused)
(Holds up his left hand)
(Pause)
(To Chandler)
(He gets up and goes to find her.)
(After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror)
(to another passenger)
(To Rachel) Thank you! (Not sure of herself)
(Disembarks)
(To Ross)
(Points)
(She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents drag him off.)
(sees Ross and Rachel)
(They hug.)
(Hugs Phoebe)
(sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the slot machine Phoebe was just at.)
(Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's "make-up.")
(Takes out her compact) I don't (She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross)
(Heads for the bathroom)
(Points in the other direction. Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)
(Does a karate chop, then does a little dance-type sway.)
(returning with her purse covering her face)
(entering)
(Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her purse.)
(To Joey)
(She hugs Joey.)
(Rolls the dice)
(walking by with his luggage)
(He turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.)
(He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.)
(They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.)
(entering)
(Holds up his hand.)
(Walks away, then turns back.)
(Heads for the bathroom.)
(on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you. (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I know it's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the phone)
(Rachel stares at him.)
(Rachel turns around and glares at him.)
(Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)
(Rachel glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.)
(she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.)
(looking at the price list)
(Opens the container)
(She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in another direction.)
(seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get! (She throws a quarter at her.)
(arm-in-arm with Monica)
(They start kissing.)
(He grabs some towels and takes them to him.)
(holds up his hand)
(tries to leave)
(stopping him) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! (Singing, to the tune of This Land is Your Land)
(Walks out.)
(following him)
(gets up) All right. Y'know what? We dont have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.)
(does so) Oohh, 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)
(Gives her the twenty she won.)
(shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the dice.)
(To Chandler)
(Rolls the dice)
(To Chandler)
(Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions to Monica and him.)
(Rolls the dice.)
(sees the roll)
(pause)
(spots one)
(To Chandler)
(She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.)
(They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.)
(He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with each one.)
(runs out of cards)
(Gets up but stumbles a little bit.) Whup, okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up, without dialing.)
(Gets up to answer it.)
(Hugs him.)
(Goes and hugs Joey.)
(He starts to sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it. Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.)
(He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.)
(Exits)
(he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the bed.)
(He points to the corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)
(bowing)
(bowing)
(Gives back her quarter.)
(to the guard) Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money. (Motions to the jackpot.)
(To Phoebe)
(quietly)
(The guard looks at the lurker.)
(To Phoebe)
(Walks out.)
(Picks up a blue sweater.)
(Starts to leave.)
(looks around) Here justtake this. (Hands her the sweater.)
(Rubs her fake stomach.)
(They run out to get married.)
(sitting down) Ahhh! (Slides his hands across the table.)
(Shakes his hands.)
(throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho! (The dealer stares at him and he stops.)
(entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks down)
(To Joey)
(He does so.)
(To Joey)
(To Phoebe)
(Starts to escort her out.)
(Motions to Joey.)
(Being dragged out by the guard)
(singing)
(Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands)
(Throws some rice.)
(Throws some more rice.)
(Gets her bearings)
(entering with Phoebe)
(They run into the chapel.)
(scolding them)
(to her) Hey! Dont you give me any of yourHey! (Sees Chandler and Monica standing there.)
(turns to the attendant)
(shocked)
(Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and groans.)
(checks)
(getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has "Just Married" written on his back.)
(Sits down.)
(Gets an idea.)
(Gets up and heads for the buffet table with Chandler in tow.)
(He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.)
(Hugs him.)
(returning with Joey)
(To Ross) I dont know. (To the gang.)
(gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
(not quite sure)
(They all turn and look at her.)
(Looks at Ross.)
(Pause)
(They hug.)
(motions to the craps table)
(They approach the craps table.)
(sarcastic)
(deadpan)
(She rolls a 3 and a 5 and theyre stunned.)
(Pause)
(They go pack.)
(They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler and Monica standing side-by-side holding each others hands.)
(Joey groans.) Come on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any (sees that hes asleep)
(wakes up)
(starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)
(to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)
(driving) Morning! (Phoebe screams again.)
(Rachel glares at him.)
(Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
(To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhikers face)
(To the hitchhiker)
(She closes the partition.)
(Rachel shakes her head.)
(thinks about it for a second)
(He goes to leave.)
(Gets out and Phoebe drives away.)
(Starts singing.)
(Exits.)
(Runs out.)
(entering, slowly)
(Gets him one.)
(Runs out.)
(Walks away.)
(Sits down next to Phoebe.)
(He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
(He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)
(trying the handle)
(Walks away.)
(Sits down next to Phoebe.)
(He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
(To Rachel)
(running out)
(The cab stops and she opens the door.) Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.)
(She bangs on the cabs roof and it pulls away.) (To Ross)
(Pause)
(to the driver)
(Bangs on the roof again and off they go.)
(entering)
(To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers him with some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)
(To Monica) No? (She nods no.)
(Tearing up) Well, uh Hey! Im really happy for you guys! Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the verge of tears as Monica stops him.)
(Turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.)
(To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if youre gonna be moving in with him I feel its my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? Hes a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm Oh-oh he always, he always ummOh, who am I kidding! Hes the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)
(gasps)
(Kisses and hugs her.)
(Phoebe joins them in the hug.)
(Winks at Ross.)
(Exits.)
(interrupting)
(to the girls)
(Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)
(entering)
(looking down)
(Awkward silence ensues.)
(To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
(They sit at the table.)
(Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct her.)
(Gasps and starts to sing)
(singing)
(Points to Karin)
(interrupting)
(leaning to him) She said, "Hes obviously still in love with this Rachel girl." (He glares at her.)
(to the panel)
(getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-Ill go to my lawyers office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth(leans down to Megs ear)
(She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)
(slapping his hand)
(entering)
(Exits.)
(gasps)
(laughs)
(Sits back and resumes her reading.)
(Monica hands her one.)
(She re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)
(entering)
(Sits down, slightly disgusted.)
(interrupting)
(Russell glares at him.)
(She holds up a chrome 5-point star.)
(grabbing the star)
(Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.)
(starting to lose her composure)
(Starts to cry.)
(They hug.)
(to Joey and Chandler)
(He goes into her apartment.)
(He hugs her.)
(entering)
(To Chandler)
(entering from her room)
(Tries to take a bite out of Rosss cookie.)
(grabs back his cookie)
(Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.)
(Phoebe raises her eyebrows.)
(taking his coffee)
(grabbing back his coffee)
(To Chandler)
(Exits.)
(in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (Exits.)
(Shows him the paper.)
(reading the ad)
(Points to his head.)
(Theres a pencil lying on the table.)
(Picks it up.)
(Points to one and starts to read it.)
(Points to one.) (Reading)
(entering)
(Rachel just looks at him.)
(Jumps up.)
(Pause)
(returning from calling Warren)
(Phoebe grunts.)
(To Ross)
(Kisses him on the cheek and exits.)
(He sits down.) (To Phoebe)
(Ross looks at her.) (Pause)
(Monica glares at him.)
(Chandler is relieved)
(Kisses her and heads into the living room.)
(Storms out.)
(exiting from Chandlers room with the new roommate)
(entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential roommate) Hi! Ill be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)
(To the potential roommate)
(Monica mocks him and he joins in.)
(stopping them)
(jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! (Storms out.)
(entering)
(Laughs.)
(laughs as well, but for a different reason)
(Points to Rachels room)
(Starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.) I just dont want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but thats what you want, theres nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DONT DO IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)
(singing)
(To Rachel)
(Hands her his keys.)
(Gets up)
(Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind. (She exits)
(on the microphone, accidentally)
(Rachel sighs.)
(opening the door to The Potential Roommate)
(He ushers her out the door.)
(She grabs it off of the freezer door.)
(Phoebe glares at him)
(in an Australian accent)
(Rosss phone rings.)
(answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone)
(holds up a pair)
(Rachel walks away.)
(under her breath) That youre a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a drawer.)
(on phone) No-no-no, thats great! Ill be there Monday. And thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All)
(Laughs her way into the living room.)
(To Ross)
(So she picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and starts reading.)
(entering)
(he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly)
(continuing)
(interrupting him)
(Resumes reading word for word from the card) "There are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler)
(gets up)
(opens and reads it)
(reads it)
(pauses)
(mocks him, in a whiney voice) look both ways before you cross the street. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)
(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)
(Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)
(Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)
(entering)
(entering)
(in obvious pain)
(Rolls over and shows Chandler.)
(Looks at the weights he was using.)
(to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica)
(to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when(sees Monica and Rachel.)
(in his British accent)
(in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her R)
(in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica aside.) (In his normal voice.)
(normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I cant?! (To an exiting student in accent.)
(in an Indian accent)
(Joey starts to groan and get up.)
(He puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on MarriedWith Children always used to do.)
(entering)
(in a gravely, painful voice)
(He turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.)
(He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he wont be able to pick it up.)
(She just looks at him.)
(Leaves)
(Groans)
(Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent) "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, wed like you to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)
(entering)
(barely audible through the pain)
(to the director)
(Joey stumbles over)
(to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. (Holds them both up.)
(to Alex) All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," thats your cue to cry. Got it? (Alex nods yes.)
(with that board thingy)
(Alex just looks at him and the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) "Take could care of your Momma son." (Alex does nothing.)
(Starts screaming.)
(he stops screaming at action) "Take good care of your Momma son." (Again Alex does nothing.)
(Joey starts screaming again.)
(He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.)
(answering it)
(Rosss divorce lawyer.)
(in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)
(British) Come again? Whats-whats this nonsense? (Giggles.) (American.) All right, Im-Im not English. Im from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. Im sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands) About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.)
(in the accent again)
(He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
(To All)
(overdoing it)
(He laughs, and he laughs alone.)
(Looks at them)
(To everyone there)
(Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My shoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)
(Goes to do so.)
(Exits.)
(coming in from the bathroom)
(not enthused)
(Exits.)
(stops)
(realizes what shes about to say and changes)
(walking up)
(looks up and sees the woman)
(checks in the window to make sure it has them)
(deadpan)
(Grabs them from him.)
(Stares at him.)
(rapidly)
(Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. Its times like these Im glad Smell-O-Vision hasnt been invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)
(He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.)
(Checking the final diaper)
(entering)
(Chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.)
(He hands them over.)
(entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)
(Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)
(entering) All right. (Clears throat)
(Mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)
(He does it again.)
(starts to cry)
(To the stenographer)
(stands up)
(stands up as well)
(notices the stenographer is still typing)What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We dont get the annulment. Dont type that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (Hes still typing.)
(to the judge)
(They both beat a hasty retreat.)
(entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes)
(Starts to leave.)
(Storms out.)
(They dont stop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)
(to women passing him)
(Storms away)
(Walks on.)
(Hes right yknow.)
(She throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.) Okay, Im sorry. I didnt mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? Cause lets face it, were at Monicas. (She crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All right. Well, thats just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the vase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you cant answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV cabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh, youre a lot mischievous! Well, itll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay, you sit with your brother and sister nowwho arent there! (They both have disappeared as well.)
(entering)
(exhausted)
(pause)
(deadpan)
(Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.)
(Sits down.)
(Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each page out of the way.)
(Gets up to leave.)
(Ross joins in)
(Pause.)
(They both laugh.)
(Exits.)
(the same one from before approaches)
(to her friend)
(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)
(watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that hes scratching his back with it.)
(Hands it to Joey.)
(looking at it)
(Hands it to him.)
(entering from her room)
(thinks)
(They kiss)
(entering from her room)
(entering)
(grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts)
(To Rachel)
(The guys scramble for the door.)
(entering and interrupting the guys escape attempt)
(quietly)
(Goes back to Rachels room.)
(to the guys)
(starting to cry)
(They hug.)
(She starts laughing hysterically.)
(Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
(scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! Thats like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, theres nothing in the fridge.) Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.)
(Joey looks at him)
(Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel)
(on phone)
(He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has created out of a pumpkin.)
(Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)
(Holds up a deck of cards.)
(He deals out two cards each.)
(He deals out two cards each again.)
(Pays him again.)
(She sees that Rachel is unpacking.)
(She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.)
(Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants "No." and Monica chants "Yes.")
(She knocks over Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)
(entering)
(Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.)
(They stop.)
(They resume the chase.)
(counts the money)
(He does.)
(Joey gets excited.) Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. Of course, any card wouldve won. Chandler pays him.)
(To Phoebe)
(To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
(She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it to get a better look.)
(answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, hows the packing going? (Listens) Ben? Hes fine. Yeah, hes rightOh my God! (He looks over at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens)
(He rolls the big white dog over)
(Gets choked up)
(Points to the couch)
(Hands it to Monica.)
(They hug again.)
(entering)
(He kisses her.)
(She turns around and hugs him.)
(She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
(As he picks up the fake Ben.)
(He looks at his cards and shrugs.)
(not amused)
(jumps over a box)
(Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
(shocked)
(Opens the door for Janine and after he closes the door behind her gasps ecstatically.)
(happily)
(chuckles)
(Runs off.)
(Starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far apart) Come on! That's not running! Let's go! (Rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)
(Kisses her on the cheek)
(Turns around and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the giggling again)
(jumps out of the box)
(pretending)
(raises his hand)
(Gives Chandler the "Joey-love," look.)
(voice cracking)
(Starts to stretch, groans painfully)
(touches his waist)
(jumps up and yells)
(Goes into the bathroom and comes back out quickly)
(jumps in front of Rachel)
(Runs off)
(enters)
(Mocking Ross)
(Picks up the phone and wipes it off)
(on phone)
(To Ross)
(Chandler fixes it and a picture frame off the table.)
(He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)
(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach)
(entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffee table...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!? (Points to Chandler)
(nonchalantly)
(Phoebe walks into her room.)
(Starts flapping her arms)
(panting)
(Rachel looks confused)
(blocks the door)
(whispers)
(to Ross)
(realizes something)
(Starts going through the photo album)
(Gives her the Joey-love look.)
(Runs into Phoebe.)
(Turns and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs off.)
(Runs out)
(Forced laughter)
(Gets her cleaning gloves on)
(Chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)
(The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh my God. What is th its like a guy never lived in here. Look, youve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.)
(Looking around the room.)
(Picking up a pillow.)
(Pointing to the table and picking up the box.)
(With Big Eyes.)
(Grunting) Hmm. (Monica opens the front door and comes in.)
(Monica leaves. To Joey.)
(Joey rolls his eyes.)
(Walking over and Sitting down.)
(She hugs Rachel.)
(chuckling)
(Hugging her again.)
(Everybody gets up.)
(Gasps)
(Rachel looks at her.)
(pointing to the picture)
(Joey takes a big whiff of the potpourri.)
(Voice cracking)
(Kim doesnt even look up from her report.)
(Kim stops the elevator and turns to Rachel.)
(He smiles. His teeth are freakishly white.)
(Sarcastically)
(With a big smile)
(turning to Monica)
(Rachel walks in.)
(Sitting down on the couch.)
(Chandler looks at her.)
(Pointing to a picture of Ralph on a magazine,.)
(Phoebe walks in.)
(Hands Chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture of Ralph.)
(Holding up the magazine in front of her face.)
(Holding a shirt in front of Ross.) Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. (Ross has a big smile.)
(Knock at the door. Phoebe enters.)
(He smiles at her.)
(Chandler gets a hurt look on his face.)
(The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)
(Dead silence until Ralph gets off the elevator.)
(Chuckling)
(Putting his hand up to block his mouth.)
(Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)
(Pointing to the dish on the table.)
(Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.) Me, neither. Ive had a really good time too, you know. (Putting the bread down.)
(Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffing it.)
(Laughing)
(Picking up their wine glasses.)
(Covering his mouth with the glass.)
(She goes to turn the lights off and Ross sits on the couch. She has some black light posters on the wall.)
(Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? (They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.)
(Faking crying.)
(Doors open, Ralph steps in.)
(Dead silence again until he gets off.)
(Hugging Rachel.)
(She starts to collect all the girlie stuff up.)
(Smiling)
(on phone) Okay, great! Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.)
(not amused by Chandlers joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler)
(Quickly trying to change subjects)
(shocked at the news)
(Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)
(trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! Ill see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)
(hugging Chandler)
(Sees Ross is there)
(only half-paying attention)
(not paying attention)
(annoyed)
(angry)
(trying to act manly in front of Janine)
(not sure of what to make of that)
(worried)
(frustrated)
(to Joey)
(less than pleased)
(angry)
(worried)
(looking at her truffle)
(teasingly)
(faking dissapointment)
(turning to Chandler in a scolding tone)
(sad)
(shrugging his shoulders to go along with it)
(frustrated)
(looks closer to see what Jack is drinking)
(whispers to Jack a little loudly)

(points to Chandler)
(to Rachel)
(sarcastically)
(Referring to the dancers.)
(scolding)
(shocked)
(cutting her off)
(just trying to get out of the conversation)
(Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to indicate to Ross that hes not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl)
(happily)
(Faking dissapointment.)
(faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey said)
(faking enjoyment)
(clearly lying and hating the dessert)
(lying)
(also lying)
(again, lying)
(Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He looks like hes going to throw up.) (Lying)
(lying)
(Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.)
(humoring Phoebe)
(out loud, to her parents)
(in a 5 year olds tone) (To Monica)
(They look at Chandler angrily.)
(joining in)
(reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...)
(pounding the table)
(rubbing her temples) Thats alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you werent supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, Im sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. (Phoebe makes a sad face.)
(Ross gets disgusted.)
(Hugs Chandler)
(In a parent-like tone)
(pointing to herself and Jack)
(Pointing to Jack)
(He imitates her stretching)
(He kisses her on the cheek)
(To Joey)
(To Monica and Ross)
(To Rachel)
(Mimics Chandler)
(Reading)
(He does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)
(To Joey)
(To Janine) You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! (He does. Janine goes over to him.)
(The girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place dance)
(He points to the right of Ross and Monica, so they dance over to where hes pointing to. He points away from them) you two! And (He points the other way, and Ross and Monica follow his arm. Again he points away.)
(Pause)
(he pretends to wash his hands) if youre right, youre right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws water on the guys pants)
(He throws another handful on him and runs out)
(They run over to a platform)
(To Cameraman) Make sure you get this, theyre gonna want it for the bloopers show. (To everyone)
(He mimics a robot)
(He continues to count as we hear Joey think)
(She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up)
(She takes his hands) 3, 2, 1. (She kisses him)
(To Ross)

(Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to Chandler.)
(Shows her the picture.)
(Rachel mocks him.)

(gasps)
(She glares at him.)
(To Rachel)
(not sure of what to do)
(Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously, dont look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)
(Looks desperately for something different.)
(gets it)
(They go into their respective apartments.)
(bursting in)
(Imitating her)
(steps up and points at her)
(To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)
(To Monica)
(to Janine) Youd better hope I dont see you in the hallway!! (They exit.)
(Starts to break up)
(He opens the door for her and she exits into the hallway.)
(They hug like men.)
(Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)
(muttering to herself)
(hearing that) Thats it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with the garbage bag)

(angrily)
(To Monica)
(laughing)
(She leaves)
(to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her coat and leaves, too.)
(showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther)
(To Monica and Rachel)
(to a table of strangers)
(He gives Monica a whats wrong with you? look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)
(Winks at him as if theyre in on a secret together.)
(He laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal)
(Joey nods.) A smile goes a long way. (Joey smiles)
(She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)
(to Ross) Dont try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly)
(He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)
(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and(He falters and Monica prompts him.)
(To Chandler)
(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say)
(embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didnt even tell him to say that. (They hug)
(happily) Im off the list. (Sits on the couch.)
(sits next to him)

(Pause as they all stare at him.)
(pauses to figure the total)
(She hands him her card.)
(giggles)

(entering)
(congested)
(She notices something hanging from Monicas nose, as does Joey.)

(Holds up this pink frilly thing)
(Jill winces.)
(covers her eyes and starts crying)
(Ross hands it to her.) And the uh, and the uh pants. Yknow what, Im just gonna take it all away, cause that way youll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, Im gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of Jills stuff.)
(Holds it up for her.)

(Holds up a glass of orange juice.)
(Points to his nose.)
(wiping her nose) Are you saying that you dont wanna get with this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesnt work all that well with the big robe.)
(in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)
(Gets an idea) (Starts singing)
(still singing)
(entering)
(on the couch)
(still sick)
(He gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. Or at least shes trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the robe off on of her legs.)
(trying to be seductive)
(She takes off her robe and starts to shiver)
(Sneezes.)
(She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)
(singing)
(Storms off.)
(entering)
(overhearing them)

(entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Rosss apartment)
(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)
(Squeaks again.)
(Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well, Im off to bed! (Goes to bed.)
(sees Rachel)
(To Rachel)
(looking)
(to Gunther) Ill take a coffee. (To Ross)

(Starts to freak out.)
(crying)

(totally not crying)
(crying)
(Gets up and gets something from the dresser underneath the TV.)
(Points to a picture.)
(Holds out a napkin and a pen.)
(Shakes his hand.) Sure! Yeah! (Signs the autograph)
(The fan leaves and Joey approaches.) (To Joey) Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? (Points) Hes a fan. (To the fan as shes leaving) Bye! (Exits)
(to the fan)
(laughs)
(Exits.)
(changing the subject)
(Gasps)
(Starts to storm out.)
(noticing the bag Joeys carrying)
(holds up the movie)
(They all kinda look at him.)
(hands the tape back to Joey, but doesnt let him grab it)
(Rachel gets up to get a closer look, only shes having some trouble.)
(sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV)
(entering) Hey! Whats up? (Sees the TV)
(He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
(picking up the book)
(Makes a bored face.)
(Points to her heart.)
(Opens the door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-thats just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, theyve really taken a liking to me. (Quickly looks out to see if theyre watching.)
(Lets her in.)
(entering)
(seeing her dress)
(Yells into the apartment) And shame on all of you! Youre disgusting! Especially you (points to someone) with that! (Storms away.)
(Goes to get it as the phone rings.)
(answering it)
(on phone)
(Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.)
(Kisses him passionately.)
(She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying to remember where hes seen her before.) (To him) Youre trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, Ill give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries to rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To Joey)
(To Rachel)
(To Monica)
(To Chandler)
(She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)
(Gently kicks him.)
(Gently kicks her back.)
(crying hysterically)
(To Ross)
(happily) Okay, see ya! (Exits.)
(starts crying) I-I cant believe Jills gone. (They all look at him.)
(To Ross)
(To Rachel)
(Giggles.)
(starts to imagine it)
(Thats karate, hes just saying it that way.)
(To Chandler)
(simultaneously)
(Closes his eyes to do so.)
(recognizing her)
(gasps)
(Shows her his ring.)
(They both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.)
(They start to leave.)
(looks at his magazine)
(laughs)
(putting the magazine back and holding the money for it)
(Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel)
(returning) Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte. (Hands it to Monica and sits down.)
(not impressed)
(Starts to sarcastically think about it.)
(entering, depressed)
(kisses her)
(Gets up to leave.) Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut. (Exits.)
(To Chandler)
(entering)
(Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.)
(Gestures towards Rachel.)
(gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug, which is quite easy for her.)
(Shes not quite sure of that one.)
(Points to him.)
(Points to her.)
(answering it)
(Joey returns from the bathroom)
(interrupting him and seeing Joey)
(stunned)
(To Rachel)
(getting up)
(holding a plate of what looks like Rice Crispies Treats) I know, here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)
(Takes the plate.)
(giggles and cant look at him)
(shaking Rachels hand)
(still not quite able to look at him)
(turning and whispering to Monica)
(To Rachel)
(Answering the phone.) Go!! Whos this? (Listens) Oh okay, youre gonna like working for me. Whats your name? (Listens)

(Exits.)
(reading the list)
(laughs)
(yelling from Monicas room)
(panicked)
(louder)
(Takes another puff of the cigarette.)

(To Ross)
(Ross looks at her.)
(entering)
(Points to Phoebes room.)
(Starts to go in.) (To Chandler)
(Points at a large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.)
(laughs)
(In Drakes voice.)
(awestruck, then not)
(In Drakes voice)
(approaching) Here you go Joe, heres the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)
(Looks at it.) Yeah, theres pulp in that. (Hands it back.)
(Turns to Rachel.)
(To Chandler)
(To Rachel)
(mouthing it to him)
(To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares at him.)
(Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
(entering) Dad!! (Runs and hugs him.)
(Runs off.)
(To Carol)
(Pause) what if we were too tie each other up? (Carols shocked and obviously doesnt like that idea.) Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. (Carol doesnt like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.)
(quickly)
(Hugs him.)
(Quickly checks her pockets and pulls out)
(entering)
(Hands him a cup.)
(They hug.)

(giggles)
(Puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.)

(To Monica)
(Rachel does a silent clap.)
(with evil dripping off his tongue)
(very relived)
(sleepily)
(She picks up the phone, Joeys phone number, and starts to dial.) Here we go! Okay! (On phone.)
(He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someones been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)
(Laughs)
(Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
(handing her a cup)
(To Ross)
(Points at Ross.)
(Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on polls. Youll have to see it to know what I mean.)
(Laughs and finishes her drink.)
(climbing down from his chair)
(Joey starts making her refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.)
(Points.)
(Starts to go.)
(She grabs him and kisses him.)
(They kiss again and his beeper goes off.)
(She starts to dig in.)
(A knock on the door interrupts him.)
(jumping up to get it)
(opening the door) Susan! Hi! (Whod you think it was gonna be?)
(They hug.)
(not taking her eyes off Carol) Hello Ross. (Takes off her coat and hands it to him.)
(Imitates him.) "Heres some little known facts about cous-cous. They didnt add the second cous until 1979." (Mumbles something further.)
(Pause.)
(Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.)
(They both realize what he just said.)
(He smiles.)
(She falls off the couch)
(She climbs back onto the couch.)
(They both laugh.)
(Takes it.)
(Points at Chandler) helping out another friend. (Points at herself.)
(They both get up.)
(He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs away.) Okay, whatcha doin there?! (Giggles.)
(Runs to shut them off.)
(sexily)
(He rolls over to do that again.)
(entering)
(wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is)
(groans)
(He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)
(seeing the ring and gasping)
(Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old man whos holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.) Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)
(not quite sure of how to answer that)
(He fakes falling asleep.)
(He laughs halfheartedly)
(Does a kara-tay move.)
(She picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)
(approaches her)
(Sits her down.)
(to Arthur, hes the guy calling 9-1-1)
(He does so.)
(Doesnt believe it.)
(whispers)
(Realizes)
(sticking his head in the door)
(Laughs.)
(Pause.)
(singing)
(hes just picked up their bill)
(Hits himself in the head.)
(she sticks her chest out and shakes it)
(reminiscing)
(To Ross) I really prefer doing that at the home office yknow? (Ross nods his head.)
(approaching with a tray with an order on it)
(points) has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! Hes complained about you three times! (He hands the coffee cup to Joey, assuming that Joey will deliver it and walks away.)
(Takes a sip of the coffee.)
(Laughs.)
(points)
(he holds two fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word)
(deadpan)
(moves closer) All Im saying is, its one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I dont know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachels and screams)
(Does the finger thing.)
(To Phoebe)
(Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)
(laughs)
(pause) and her brother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared)
(interrupting him)
(Does one of those gibberish words.)
(She takes out a sock thats been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and two other socks sown onto it for ears.)
(She sticks it in Rachels face and they both laugh.)
(admiring his work) This, this actually is a (Does the same gibberish word from before.)
(entering)
(They kiss.) Okay, I cant wait! This is going to be the best Valentines Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.)
(sticking his head back in)
(Chandler does another sarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.)
(to the receptionist)
(She just looks at him in horror.)
(Hands it to him.)
(Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points to one.)
(Joey beats a hasty retreat.)
(He starts doing the finger thing every time now.)
(Monica comes out to throw out the garbage and Ross screams) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.)
(in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to reveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back at his script.)
(not turning around)
(does the finger thing)
(Picks up a model of the Saturn V rocket, thats the one that took man to the moon.)
(Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the famous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)
(She does the finger thing.)
(He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way, and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then he holds it out as if hes giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) I cant do it. I cant do it. (He throws them both down and continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)
(She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the couch.)
(momentarily terrified)
(points to the kitchen), and I am going to do anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
(thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They both run into the bedroom.)
(To the sock bunny still on his hand.)
(Covers its eyes.)
(Referring to the sock bunny.)
(Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
(He goes to the fridge) Just gettin a soda! (Does so.)
(entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doin?! How you doinDamnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.)
(Does the international hand symbol for so-so.)
(sticking his head back in)
(to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.)
(gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey silences him with a grunt.)
(entering) (To the receptionist) Can I have the next one please? (Takes the form.) Joey and Tony Tribbiani. (Joey and Carl stand up.)
(seeing theyre not identical)
(They kiss.)
(He tries to kiss her but Monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.)
(The instructor just nods and walks away.)
(He glares at him.)
(not buying it)
(points to the kitchen), and do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
(pointing to the kitchen) Yeah you will! (Points to the bedroom)
(They hug.)
(Enter her room and closes the door behind her.)
(He starts to run towards them.)
(She starts to get up.)
(stopping her)
(Ross is stunned.)
(angrily)
(sarcastically)
(entering from the bathroom)
(on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the gang.)
(on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up)
(The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)
(another professor) Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester! (Ross frantically starts to change some as a female student, Elizabeth, approaches.)
(startled)
(Leans up against the board and on a thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)
(Starts to leave.)
(Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes)
(They both run into the bedrooms.)
(to the fireman)
(To Chandler)
(Hold it up.)
(Hands it back to her.)
(stands up)
(pulling Rachel back down)
(To the fireman)
(Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler nods yes.)
(on phone)
(Chandler waves him away.)
(Joey mimes throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey)
(on phone) Hi! Im back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, well do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)
(To Joey)
(He turns around to see Chandler glaring at him.)
(laughs)
(giggles)
(To Rachel)
(She jumps on the bed.)
(He points to the chair.) And uh thats where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)
(Shrugs his shoulders.)
(exiting from a restaurant)
(pushing Elizabeth into a doorway)
(Its the same location as before.) AndHey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in its spot.)
(Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe)
(Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens)
(in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it was the candles. Its very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh Uhh Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)
(Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.) (To Monica)
(entering)
(Does the international sign for big boobies.)
(breaking up)
(He runs off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)
(Reaches for one.)
(pulling the plate back)
(gritting her teeth)
(opening the door)
(He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
(He picks it up and eats it.)
(He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
(They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)
(Hands her another one.)
(entering, sees Rachels throw)
(To Joey)
(Chandler doesnt say anything until Joey figures it out.) You got me the audition?! Lets hug it up! (They hug.)
(Joey puts him down.)
(entering)
(To Rachel)
(Runs out.)
(To Rachel)
(Examining the bowl of wet paper towels.)
(She grabs the bowl and heads for Monicas.)
(She starts to get all worked up.)
(feeling it too)
(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a second Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)
(He grabs a screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and shocks himself.)
(Exits.)
(Pats Joeys arm, Joey pats Chandlers shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same about him.)
(laughs) Isnt she cute? (On Monicas death stare)
(He winks at her.)
(Elizabeth exits.)
(interrupting)
(entering)
(laughs sarcastically)
(She squeezes the skin on her chin together to form)
(horrified)
(Laughs.)
(To Chandler)
(not quite sure where Joeys going and is a little worried)
(pause)
(Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth)
(Laughs then composes himself)
(quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger Ill be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)
(He walks up close to whisper in Rosss ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)
(He opens the door and feels inside.)
(pause)
(He opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.)
(They both laugh.)
(He has trouble sitting in his chair.)
(Does a little whooping/party noise.)
(Does that party noise again.)
(Imitates the party noise.)
(Chandlers shocked.)
(He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)
(shocked)
(Hands her, her cup.)
(To Rachel)
(Exits.)
(To Monica)
(Imitates him.)
(whispers)
(entering)
(To Ross)
(notices something) what-what is uh, whats this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)
(Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)
(To Rachel)
(Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)
(Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)
(They start to leave but run into Phoebe with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe)
(Points to him.)
(To Phoebe)
(looks) Oh my God, youre right! I am too late; theyre sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.)
(To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits Patrick down next to Rachel.)
(stopping him)
(Chandler stops her)
(Both he and Monica do so.)
(To Patrick)
(To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad)
(She gets up to yell at her friends.)
(Chandler shushes him.)
(To Patrick) congratulations on all the cash, (He nods) and-and yknow(Feels Eldads hair)Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly, and to Eldad)
(Storms out.)
(entering)
(she stops reading from the script)

(tremendously overacting) Fine! Ill do it without you! (Joey gives her thumbs up) I dont need you or anybody else! Im gonna make it on my own! (Joey closes the door to his bedroom.)
(To Joey)
(To Phoebe)
(Mentioning the girl on TV)
(Does this intense look where it looks like he's smelling a fart.)
(there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..." (Does the smell-the-fart look.)
(on stage in an Austrian accent) Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)
(trying not to laugh)

(entering, dejectedly)
(Laughs.)
(stops laughing)
(on phone)
(on the phone) Monica, Im quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didnt even buy it! (Pause) Im telling you Im quitting! Thats it! Im talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up.)
(The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his hands up Phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)
(The flashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.)
(getting upset)
(jumping to his feet in anger)
(trying to remain in control)
(losing control, we hear him shout outside)
(Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
(struggles to get this out) Monicas allergies. (The duck quacks.) Youre right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs, then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joeys not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? (Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)
(startled)
(looks down at his clothes)
(Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)
(on phone) Hello? (Listens) What are you talking about? The auditions not til 5:00! (Chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as Joey listens.) Well, nobody told me! (Listens) Whod you talk to? (Listens and turns around to see Chandler trying to finish the message.) Nevermind! (Hangs up.)
(lets him out)
(getting out)
(Sees Chandler.)
(Chandler has a disgusted look on his face.)
(Chandler gets that disgusted look back.)
(mocking him)
(they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel)
(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
(coming out from behind the door)
(starts doing lunges)
(The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joeys not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) Hes still got a chance for the part?! Oh, thats great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, thats great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what hes writing) Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. (Pause)
(angrily)
(shocked)
(overacting badly)

(Points to a guy.)
(Starts touching the guys cheeks)
(slaps Wayne on his cheek) How do you do there, Wayne? (Backs away.)
(Walks away.)
(Mimics that cheek thing he just did.)
(He puts on his headset, picks up the controller, and wheels C.H.E.E.S.E. in. C.H.E.E.S.E. is just a plain old robot on tracks; he kinda looks like No. 5 in the movie Short Circuit.)
(Wayne with a computerized voice)
(laughs)
(He moves C.H.E.E.S.E.s arm close to Joeys special area and he jumps back.)
(Pause, then serious)
(Ross laughs in relief) You got one minute. (Ross suddenly gets worried.)
(Ross starts laughing.)
(laughs then checking his watch)
(Paul is not amused.)
(Runs and gives all of them a group hug.)
(obviously attracted to him)
(He goes to pull out Elizabeths chair, but Paul steps in)Yeah, why dont you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Yknow? Whatever pops into your head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)
(Monica turns in horror.)
(He starts laughing then notices that Paul isnt happy.)
(returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets down their cups.)
(writing frantically)
(Chandler and Monica kiss.)
(seeing him)
(Hes looking around.)
(Finds some under one of the couch cushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.)
(Throws them back under the cushion.)
(Picks them up from underneath the corner of the couch.)
(Starts to leave.)
(chasing after him)
(Rachel laughs then starts looking at him.)
(He taps his index fingers together.)
(sympathetic)
(She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels)
(His cell phone rings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone)
(on the other end)
(He runs into his bedroom.)
(coming out of the bedroom)
(Kisses her.)
(Leaves)
(incredulous)
(Starts to leave, but stops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. (Exits.)
(Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
(writing in her book)
(writing on a piece of paper)
(still writing)
(Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)
(He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.s arm and pulls it off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, thats why you didnt want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it. Meanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I cant believe it! God! (A very beautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin? (He and her go over to talk and Wayne looks on with envy.)
(to Paul)
(pause) many stories that Rachel has told me that, well (pause) youre not (pause)
(pause)
(Realizes) Oh, Im sorry! (To Elizabeth)
(Rachel returns and hears that.)
(pause as the audience reacts)
(Turning around in the chair)
(Reading her book)
(disgusted)
(To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (Hes wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
(reading from her book) Mon (Pause as she restarts)
(writing in her book)
(They shake hands.)
(incredulous)
(whispering in Joeys ear)
(happily)
(Off Chandlers look)
(Everyone looks at her, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)
(She nods in the affirmative.)
(to Paul)
(Pause, pointing at Ross)
(returning)
(Pauses as he waits for C.H.E.E.S.E.s next line.) Its your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Suddenly C.H.E.E.S.E. goes crazy and starts flinging its arms and advancing on Joey behind the desk.)
(dejected)
(nodding knowingly)
(Hits Chandler)
(entering)
(Paul enters)
(gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles)
(The dry cleaner doesnt remember) Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.)
(picking up a TV Guide)
(Walks away)
(to the couple) You can put the aisle over here (points), and put the wedding ceremony right over here. (Points.)
(Points to both places.) I mean youd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.)
(To Monica)
(She kinda storms out with the couple.)
(Rachel agrees.)
(entering)
(Holds out his picture.)
(quietly)
(loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.)
(laughs)
(from another room)
(To Rachel)
(on machine) Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening. (to himself)
(on phone) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available (Chandler runs to answer the phone.)
(on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens)
(She sets down her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and causes Rachel to scream.)
(Gets up and heads for the kitchen.)
(After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.)
(entering) Here you go honey! (Rachel kicks Ross back under the couch.)
(Hands her the glass.)
(He goes to get the ice.)
(under the couch)
(Ross gets up and heads for the kitchen.) No! Not in there! Hes in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the kitchen.)

(on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The machine beeps off.)
(She makes eyes at him.)
(Pause) Youre the other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)
(to Paul)
(whispering) Okay. (Starts for the car.)
(yelling)
(standing in front of a mirror and to himself) Just relax. Just relax Paul, youre doing great. (Ross moves a piece of luggage over so he can watch Paul.) She likes you. She Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Yknow why? Because youre a (pause) neat guy. (Ross cant believe what hes hearing.) You are the man. You are (pause) the man! (He opens his shirt and looks at his chest.) I still got it. Nice and sexy. Youre just a love machine. (Starts singing) Im just a love machine and I wont work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! (Flexes and grunts loudly.) Showtime. (Starts to leave and starts singing.) Im just a love machine, yeah ba-by! (Grunts again and Ross is stunned.)
(Phoebe gasps.)
(Mimicking her.)
(Runs out.)
(Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire picture.)
(entering)
(The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)
(Starts yelling at him in Russian, and Im betting hes not saying pleasant things about him.)
(He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) Im gonna go out this window. (Points to the window next to him.)
(yelling from the living room)
(to Elizabeth)
(Runs over to Rachel.)

(Hums a little bit and mimics Pauls flexing.)
(going over to him)

(Gets up to leave, but Paul doesnt move.)
(points to it)
(Pointing to himself.)
(Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) Its a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)
(Goes to another display counter.) Oh, this ones nice! (Pointing to another ring.)
(coming over after returning the musket)
(Holds out the ring, deadpan.)
(choking up)
(To the jeweler)

(To the jeweler)
(Holds them up from his pocket.)
(handing them the bill)
(Starts to get his money)
(Hands Gunther Chandlers card.)
(They both reflect on that briefly)
(The male jeweler hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler)
(He hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.)
(to the female jeweler)
(Points to the one walking out the store.)
(She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which locks the stores door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)
(Starts to look for his credit card.)
(acting manly to try and cover up his crying)
(Starts to breakdown again.)
(Paul rushes over and hugs Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)
(Pushes him away.)
(entering)
(Goes over and hugs Joey and picks him off of his feet.)

(Pause)
(They shake hands.)
(In a sexy voice)
(Flips a couple pages and points to something.)
(sits on the counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage)
(barely glancing at her) No. What ever happened to that little dude. (Pause)
(Starts to breakdown.)
(Feeling his shoulder.) And Im glad that youre done. What do you say we umm (Nods in the direction of the bedroom.)
(They kiss.)
(Starts crying again.)
(entering from her room)
(Does so and laughs.)
(Points.)
(Walks over to him.)
(To Chandler)
(to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, Im gonna need to have that back. (The guy isnt sure.) But, in exchange Im willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.)
(Phoebe)
(interrupting her)
(Pause)
(Holds the ring up for him.)
(looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)
(To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and hes horrified.)
(They ignore him.) Ive got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause)
(To Ross)
(Shows it to them.)
(They hug.)
(goes to hug him and stops short)
(They hug.)
(who has just entered)
(Hugs him.)
(holding an empty tissue box) Wheres all the tissues?! (Throws the box down in disgust.)
(gasps)
(entering)
(Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)
(entering)
(with her mouthful)
(To Phoebe)
(with his mouthful)
(To Chandler) Were practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and winks at him.)
(entering)
(glaring at her)
(Points to Phoebe and Joey.)
(entering)
(Ross glares at him.)
(Makes like a gun with his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in all excited.)
(Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.)
(Hands him back the ring.)
(to the rest of them)
(To Monica)
(The gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears knowing glances.) (Monica giggles.)
(breaking up)

(She introduces them.)
(They shake hands.)
(behind them) Oh!! Shrimp toast! (Walks right past the little group on his way for the shrimp toast.)
(Mr. Thompson walks away and after hes left.) Okay, (writing her bid down)
(The last part is to discourage e-mails, who cares if I got it right or not?)
(Runs over and closes the door.)
(Does a laugh/groan.)

(approaching with two filled balloons in her hands) Nobody! We put them in here! (Indicates the aforementioned balloons causing both of them to scream in delight and start drinking from the balloons.)
(To Ross) You want some?! (Starts to squirt the Kamikaze at him.)
(Stops her.)
(screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)
(Pause.)
(Joey suddenly gets excited.)
(Pulls him down.)
(trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (Its a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)
(Starts to take it off and then realizes)
(laughs)
(interrupting him)
(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation)
(Yep, Richards back.)
(She nods towards the doorway, Chandler turns and looks)
(approaching them with a woman in tow)
(Gets up and hugs him.)
(to Richards date) And uh, you dont have a mustache which is good. (She just smiles.)

(Whispering and thinking.)
(laughing)
(Everyone raises their glasses)
(Hes excited about what he thought happened.)
(stopping him from going any further)
(Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes)

(Ross pauses in consideration.)
(To Phoebe)
(To Phoebe)
(She gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy shes wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.)
(She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only shakes it.)

(Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause)
(Pause)
(Starting to cry.)
(He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.)
(yelling through the door)
(Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)
(grabbing the candy bar)
(Hugs Chandler.)
(yelling at the top of her lungs)
(Someone else yells at her.) No, I will not shut up because Im engaged! (He yells again.) Ohh, big talk! Huh, why dont you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! (Chandler starts to look worried.)
(To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey)
(Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a toast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say thatI love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.)
(Raises his class.)
(To Monica)
(Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.)
(To Phoebe)
(looking at her hand) Yknow what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) Youre not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)
(lustily) Lets do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.)
(chasing after him)
(motioning with his hands) Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated. Yknow its like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)
(Singing)
(Rachel comes out of the bathroom)
(quietly)
(Screams.)
(Thinking)
(to his hands)
(Ross looks at her.) Oh no, not that. (Ross nods okay.)

(To Ross)
(starting to cry) Im sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.)
(deadpan) Well, Im going to take off. (To Chandler)

(returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3" 3-ring binder on the table.)
(She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.)
(To Chandler, under her breath)
(Phoebe rushes in.)
(To the class.) Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each others hometowns? Why dont you (Motions that they should learn everyones hometown.) (To Phoebe)
(to the students)
(Off of Rachel and Monicas looks)
(sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up one.)
(Holds up a picture of each.)
(Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just think theyre a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.)
(sitting up again)
(Gets up and heads for the door.)
(The duck does not get sick and Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream? (Hes about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachels room. He walks into her room and feels the bed.) Thats so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.) Pillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.) (In his head.) Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar(Stops reading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) wouldnt be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! (Continues to read.)
(pause as she considers it)
(nervously)
(pause)
(gasps)
(She goes into her room.)
(deadpan)
(Calls down the hall) Dad! (Her old father walks in.) Thank you so much, Ill be back to pick him up in an hour. (She walks away.)
(ignoring her)
(incredulous)
(Chandler and her laugh, but her parents dont.)
(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
(Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)
(He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh, thats soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those.)
(Pause)
(gasps)
(She starts to cry, as does Monica.)
(Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)
(Whispers.)
(To Chandler)
(starting to cry)
(reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice)
(laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs)
(quietly)
(sitting down)
(takes a drink) Damn, this coffees cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)
(Exits.)
(chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.)
(entering)
(looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe)
(incredulous)
(They hug and kiss.)
(laughs)
(They kiss.)
(sarcastically)
(Giggles.)
(starting to move closer to him)
(nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)
(moves the stool out of the way)
(He backs into the kitchen.)
(He backs into the door.)
(Points to his glasses.)
(sitting down on the arm of her chair)
(She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of the gang.)
(interrupts him)
(entering)
(He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)
(Does it again.)
(entering from the bathrooms)
(pauses as he figures out how to answer that)
(She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)
(To Chandler)
(drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel)
(Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)
(Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them)
(grabs some of the rigging)
(She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)
(Laughs)
(entering)
(He grabs whats left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)
(recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)
(She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.)
(entering with Chandler)
(Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.)
(You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
(You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the door as Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sits next to him with a shocked expression on his face.)
(takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) Im sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, Ill call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)
(getting up)
(laughing)
(Exits.)
(To Rachel)
(entering)
(Storms off.)
(Burps a little bit.)
(Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesnt like it.) Its batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
(Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.)
(Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.)
(yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
(hurrying over)
(Grabs and opens one.)
(The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
(She does it instead.)
(angrily)
(Pause) (Angrily)
(Points to it. Its the larger sail.)
(grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)
(reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.)
(Looking down)
(Points.)
(She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees whats in the cooler.)
(hands him one)
(She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)
(Gasps.)
(on TV) Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives dont mix. (Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel, Chandler, and Monica arent amused.)
(laughing and turning off the TV)
(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, its your mom. (Hands him the phone.)
(on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what theyre gonna say.)
(Points to the TV)
(hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.)
(entering, excitedly)
(entering from bathrooms excitedly)
(To Monica and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp)
(groans in disgust)
(ignoring him)
(gasps)
(jumps up)
(reading the resume)
(Hilda exits)
(seeing him)
(Taking his resume)
(Looking at his resume)
(She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.)
(Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
(To Monica)
(To Chandler)
(Kisses him.)
(Monica laughs hysterically.)
(Pause)
(angrily)
(Takes out his picture.)
(Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh But no! No! You cant-you cant hire him, because thatits not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)
(Phoebe hands him the picture.)
(Holds out the script.)
(looking between the pages and him)
(Pause)
(Throws the script away)
(Notices her plant)
(Sets the plant down on her desk.)
(Starts to leave.)
(Kisses him.)
(entering)
(notices the table)
(The oven dings.)
(Holding up one of the shells.)
(Quietly to Chandler) I still cant eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.)
(trying not to laugh)
(To Chandler)
(Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
(To Monica)
(Runs off laughing which gets Chandler laughing.)
(To Chandler)
(running up to Ross)
(To Chandler)
(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To Phoebe and Rachel) Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next weeks script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like theyre taking it off the air? (Listens) Ohh. (Listens) All right, see you Monday. (Listens) Were not even shootin them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up)
(Laughing)
(Threateningly)
(To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross)
(Hangs up.)
(He turns and looks at her.)
(shyly)
(Giggles.)
(Goes into office.)
(grabbing Phoebe) Okay. Well be right back. (They go into her office and she closes the door.)
(Theres a knock on the door.)
(Kathy leaves dejectedly.)
(Gets up)
(He walks over to the bed, leans down, and whispers to him.)
(jumping up and removing the bandages)
(To Monica)
(Holds his watch in front of her face.)
(Ross laughs.) What are you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)
(gets up)
(Monica mouths, "Im sorry.")
(noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.)
(Motions for him to sit down.)
(Pause)
(Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth, this shall be known as The Face.)
(looking at one)
(Does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.)
(Does The Face while saying that last part.)
(To Chandler)
(Doing the standard "This Close" gesture)
(returning)
(startled) Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, whats up? Im just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Yknow, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. Whats up? (She has put on the backpack.)
(taking pictures)
(Does The Face.)
(He smiles, beautifully.)
(They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.)
(Youll have to see it, I cant describe the face he makes, but it isnt good.)
(Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.)
(Hands him one.)
(He doesnt like it.)
(Sees something.)
(He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all over himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)
(Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" (The photographer laughs.)
(Smiles.)
(Points to it.)
(To Chandler)
(She walks over to the couch.)
(Points)
(She holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)
(Pause) All right, Ill do it. But just because youre a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)
(Points to her hand.)
(Hands over the key.)
(Phoebe slams the door shut.)
(To Ross)
(opens the door and to Whitney)
(Closes the door.) (To Phoebe)
(interrupting him)
(outside the door)
(Pause)
(To her, in the Joey voice)
(Chandler immediately does The Face.)
(Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and smiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down)
(Chandler nods.)
(entering)
(Pause)
(shocked)
(Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)
(He waves his arms around to get their attention.)
(To Joey)
(Pause.)
(seeing him approach)
(They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look down, look down (He falls asleep.)
(awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
(angrily)
(gets up and starts to leave)
(Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.)
(He hands her, her mail)
(panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it) Hello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and she closes the door behind him, disgustedly.)
(Quietly)
(Pause)
(To Whitney)
(They get up to leave.)
(They leave.)
(To Phoebe)
(Shes pronounces potato with the both the short and long As.)
(She opens it up and shows it to them.)
(The camera cuts to a shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)
(She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe)
(laughs)
(A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandlers name and starts listening closer)
(To Monica and Rachel)
(looking at the tape)
(gasps)
(Rachel stops talking.)
(They hug.)
(Phoebe exhales as if to say, "Like what isnt?")
(Pause, then Joey wants to shake Rosss hand.)
(sarcastically)
(Thinks a little while.)
(Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)
(pause)
(Monica is not amused by that statement.)
(Phoebe glares at him.)
(shocked)
(To Rachel)
(Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.)
(Rachel and Phoebe exit.)
(Ross just leaves.)
(Knocks on the door.)
(Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.)
(Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel youre up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: Youre with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)
(crying)
(out of his Monica character)
(playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember that(Phoebe screams and tackles him)
(Ross and Joey start writing.)
(Grabs a glass and holds it up)
(To Ross)
(To Joey)
(Raises her glass and drinks.)
(she opens the door)
(To Monica)
(Pause as she nods no.)
(Hmm, I wonder where Ive heard that before.)
(Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)
(Runs out.)
(running after her) Rach, its gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey)
(Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)
(Monica glares at him.)
(They hug and kiss.)
(Rachel looks at her.)
(Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and heres a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse)
(Starting to cry.)
(Starts to cry again.)
(Shes referring to the Halloween picture.)
(looking at the picture again)
(entering)
(gasps) Ohh, wow! Thats great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; well get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? Im so excited! (Runs out leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)
(Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)
(reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! (Heads for his room leaving Ross.)
(slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
(She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts Joey.)
(Pause) Now, whered we land on those pancakes? (She chases him out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)
(pause)
(They start heading that way, towards a secluded section behind the racks.)
(stopping quickly) Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.)
(as they are moving past Ross)
(to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around to face the planets most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of course. Shes the most annoying female TV character however.)
(Does the laugh.)
(notices Monicas engagement ring)
(laughs)
(Erin turns around to face Joey, startling him)
(Kisses him.)
(to Erin)
(They start to walk away.)
(To Rachel) Huh? Youre the one whos in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe)
(He storms out.)
(Rachel looks at him.)
(entering with Erin)
(skeptical)
(still skeptical)
(does a retching sound)
(still skeptical)
(The librarian brings his boss over.)
(He turns to look at the previous librarian.)
(Starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian)
(gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.)
(To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)
(Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)
(She says something in Italian, and it doesnt matter what she said. Its not important so I dont need everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)
(returning)
(whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)
(Grabs a book from the shelf behind him)
(The couple retreats. Ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.)
(Grabs his book off of the shelf.)
(Heads for his room.)
(Joey goes into his room.)
(coming back out)
(To Monica)
(Joey walks into view of the open door behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.)
(To Chandler)
(starting to cry)
(She runs for the bathroom)
(Makes some weird sound) Do you have a cat? Cause its already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)
(Starts for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)
(to the guard) Dont sweat it, Ive got this section covered. Yeah, in fact Ive got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in peoples eye(The guard walks away)
(Ross just glares at him.)
(entering)
(looks over to Monica)
(Thats true in so many ways, trust me, Ive lived in one and been to the other.)
(Joey strikes one from his list)
(counting the place settings)
(Laughs)
(Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)
(Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)
(Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)
(Monica heads out)
(gets up)
(entering, to Joey and Rachel)
(Grabs her jacket)
(A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's bag. Everyone looks puzzled.)
(Walks towards the window and looks out)
(answering the phone)
(Looks around.)
(Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.)
(gets up and opens the door)
(He enters)
(walks to Phoebe's door)
(Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.)
(She bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws)
(gasping)
(interrupting him)
(to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, "Do what you have to do")
(Waves bye-bye.)
(He jumps up, screaming)
(scared)
(to Tag)
(to Phoebe)
(An awkward silence ensues.)
(Gets up with Monica to do so.)
(Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
(to Monica and Phoebe)
(They hug)
(through the window)
(realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)
(He shakes his head)
(He starts to walk towards the railing.)
(looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (He points down to the street)
(Sound of a breaking car-window)
(He walks back in again)
(she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and theyre-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too)
(doing Clunkers)
(She goes back to Clunkers again)
(comes out of the bathroom)
(Heads back into the bathroom)
(interrupts him)
(She rushes into her room)
(comes out of the bathroom)
(He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)
(entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face)
(He walks out)
(He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying)
(sits down next to Ross)
(In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again)
(opens her bedroom door and peeks out)
(gasps)
(interrupts her, to Monica)
(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)
(uncovers the dog)
(to Clunkers)
(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believing her)
(Comes over to Tag)
(Walks back to his map dejectedly.)
(He kisses her)
(Starting to cry.)
(hands Chandler his pad and walks in)
(Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it)
(pauses)
(Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
(on the bike)
(Does so.)
(To Chandler)
(Ross pushes him off.)
(Everyone stands and claps.)
(shocked)
(They all turn and look at him.)
(Theyre all speechless)
(They all nod, "Oh.")
(Points to the one sitting on the table)
(entering, happily)
(pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly)
(Joey and Chandler start to giggle.)
(The mail guy leaves and Tag starts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. (They kiss.)
(She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)
(Motions towards Joeys door.)
(Starts to do so.)
(Monica runs to make more candy.)
(gasps)
(She hugs him.)
(stunned at the complement)
(starts to leave, but stops)
(about to cry)
(turning a light on)
(They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.)
(To Chandler)
(laughs)
(Monica looks at him) (To Monica)
(looking at Monica.)
(Monica closes the door.)
(hugging him)
(worried)
(about to cry)
(The gang is giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack, gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.)
(To Chandler)
(with his mouth full)
(He shows her what hes been drawing.)
(Points to her new sign.)
(watching the discussion)
(still talking to the woman)
(exasperatedly)
(after Monica gives her the candy)
(closing the door)
(Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)
(hopping off the bike)
(thinks it over)
(She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They start.)
(Does so.)
(Ross pushes her and lets go.)
(He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him and falls off the bike.)
(She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.)
(Looking around and seeing the woman behind him glaring at him.)
(She glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebes room.)
(seeing him)
(entering)
(Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that suspiciously looks like a bike.)
(Ross rings the bell.)
(Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you dont ride it you-youre-youre killing its spirit! (Pause)
(He runs to the door.)
(sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike)
(Holding up the box of chocolates.)
(worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to usher Tag out.)
(Holds up the box.)
(Rachel glances at Tag to say, "See?")
(laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting serious)
(interrupting)
(interrupting again)
(pause)
(Grabs the evaluation and throws it out.)
(They both nod no.) No? Okay, well uh, youve (Grabs the chocolates.) got my fax number. (Exits.)
(They kiss.)
(Rachel laughs) In fact! (Walks over to her desk, sweeps its contents onto the floor and Rachel just glares at him.)
(He bends over to pick the stuff up.)
(looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
(asking a man leaning against the wall)
(Yelling at the door.)
(They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy)
(opening the door and frantically)
(And other general commotion sounds.)
(They settle down)
(from earlier)
(imitating)
(stepping in and knocking the man over)
(Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to the candy and starts eating it.)
(To Chandler)
(They kiss.)
(with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I dont know (Grabs the note.)
(She rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly attached.)
(Hangs up the phone)
(Corrects him)
(entering carrying a skull)
(Puts the skull on the table)
(freaking out)
(She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of licorice, and takes a bite.)
(entering)
(Offering Ross the skull)
(Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one)
(He exits)
(to Monica)
(entering)
(Chandler and Monica look surprised) Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Yknow? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)
(entering)
(Starts drumming.)
(yelling)
(to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? (Laughs.)
(pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d')
(Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly) Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)
(Walks back to Monica)
(Shows her his left hand with the money in it)
(Ben and Ross sit down on the couch)
(Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesnt.)
(singing)
(interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh (Sings)
(singing)
(interrupts him again)
(He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap)
(disappointed)
(sees two people exit)
(walks up to the Maitre d')
(to the Maitre d') Good evening. (Shakes his hand)
(finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his money, but he isn't there anymore)
(stopping at Phoebes entrance)
(To Rachel)
(She exits disappointedly.)
(He gets up, and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just helping him to pick them up.)
(He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters)
(Gives her the coins)
(she sits down next to him)
(entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you another present. (She puts it on the counter)
(He plays a drum-roll)
(Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool jumping up)
(Looks into the cage)
(He storms into his room)
(sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)
(nods along)
(She runs to the drums and gets the sticks)
(with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and puts the sticks into it)
(Points to Ben)
(to Monica)
(He tries to bend down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume)
(gasps)
(to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben)
(entering in a Santa costume)
(Runs to Chandler and hugs him)
(Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
(He shakes Ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there)
(to Chandler)
(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
(They kiss.)
(Ross nods)
(entering wearing a Superman costume)
(yelling from another room)
(returning)
(Phoebe nods, "No.")
(She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly)
(Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.)
(returning slowly)
(They hug.)
(answering him)
(Glaring at Joey whos nodding.)
(Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben, and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
(entering with Phoebe)
(seeing the collection of characters.)
(yelling from the bedroom)
(Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.)
(Chandler puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to look at the label on the box.)
(nervously)
(Gasping)
(Reading the label) Mommas Little Bakery. (Pause)
(taking a bite)
(Joey exits.)
(Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica)
(Monica looks at him then sushes him.)
(Hands it to Rachel.)
(reading the note) "Pheebs, cant make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." (Laughs)
(Monica shakes her head in disgust.)
(entering)
(Motions that their friendship)
(They hug.)
(Chandler motions no.)
(Pause)
(closing the box)
(They exit with the cheesecake.)
(entering)
(Screechingly)
(disgusted)
(interrupting)
(Does so.)
(laughs)
(Rachel laughs then Chandler notices something.)
(gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman is still lying in front of her door.)
(They move closer to it.)
(Rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.)
(gasps) (whispering)
(noticing Phoebe)
(He kisses her cheek)
(excited)
(disappointed)
(They go over and talk.)
(taking a bite)
(entering)
(seeing what theyre doing)
(He makes a disgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)
(He starts taking off his pants.)
(Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)
(Pulls up his pants.)
(Reading the name cards.)
(To the couple sitting to her right.)
(To Monica)
(to the couple on her left)
(To Joey)
(She grabs his menu and hands it to the waiter.)
(Putting Joeys menu under his arm.)
(Grabs his menu and starts looking at it again. The waiter leaves.)
(checking her watch)
(returning)
(Gets up and leaves.)
(She exits.)
(to the waiter)
(Kisses her hand.)
(Grabs his arm.) Come on! Were going to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)
(with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)
(She tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.)
(Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)
(Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.)
(examining the cake)
(Points.)
(Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and dont come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. (As shes saying that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.)
(gloatingly and holding his piece)
(Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.)
(Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to grab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a napkin.)
(Starts to get up and great Frannie.)
(He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on Frannies shoulder.)
(turning around)
(to Frannie)
(Frannies husband walks up.)
(He speaks Russian.)
(They kiss.)
(He gets in and the cab drives off. Joey walks up and witnesses that event.)
(seeing him)
(He hugs her.)
(Crying.)
(They hug again.)
(pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin? (Starts digging in.)
(Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt Millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her attention.)
(He wipes his mouth on Monicas wrap and walks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)
(looking up)
(Well, technically youd be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of New York.)
(groaning) Oh no! Oh no! (They all start to get up a leave.)
(Comets dont streak across the sky, meteors do.)
(They start to leave again.)
(looking up)
(looking up with her)
(Yeah, you can see what? Five of them from the city?)
(looking through his binoculars at a nearby building)
(Turns around to point it out to Ross and finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and starts looking for the comet.)
(She walks over to where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)
(with a quivering voice)
(Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.)
(They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)
(whispering)
(Runs over to where Joeys standing.)
(Bends down to get a closer look.)
(standing up)
(Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)
(noticing the pipe and looking at the door)
(annoyed) I dont know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.) (Pause)
(Joey starts to groan.)
(covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the door.)
(whispering)
(Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover Im like(Fake snores.)
(Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
(crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please dont be a space ship. Please dont be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and finds that its the smoke detector thats beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she yanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets there it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.)
(standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we dont have a choice. (Screaming to the street)
(Points it out.)
(To Joey) I know, I wasnt finished. (Joey motions him to finish.) (Yelling at the street)
(Monica enters)
(Chandlers holding a wok.)
(Pause)
(They start to head for the bedroom)
(Shakes his head that its not working.)
(He starts laughing.)
(Sits down.)
(They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel suddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook this? (Her bra.)
(Joey looks at him.)
(looks at the ground and at Ross)
(Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.)
(She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has stopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke detector.) (Yelling.)
(She sees that Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)
(startled)
(Hands the mug of milk to him.)
(Finds a picture.)
(She goes into her office.)
(Looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave Tag)
(He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the phone.)
(He doesnt respond and she turns on the light, waking him.)
(intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.)
(looking in the window behind them)
(Knocks on the glass, which angers the big, large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the landing.) When you get in there (Joey nods his disapproval.)
(She drops the blanket into the chute.)
(She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)
(turning the light back on)
(Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Dont fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesnt move as he gets out of bed and as hes heading for the door.)
(She looks for a place to set it on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.)
(He opens the top drawer.) Well, no its not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one and he opens it. She doesnt see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)
(thinks) Yknow, I dont-I dont know. Let me, let me check. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at Tag, looks into her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)
(smirking)
(entering) Yeah? (She holds up the folder) You found them!! (Rachel is not amused, because shes still going to try to blame him for her mistake like every good boss.)
(I think Dogbert should have a line here.)
(pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed)
(scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the blanket with the smoke detector.)
(She takes the blanket.)
(He exits and she goes to shut it off.) Theres a reset button! My God! Why didnt I see that! (She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.) Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.)
(grunting)
(looking down)
(angrily)
(Looks at the clock)
(laughs)
(glaring at her)
(Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.) Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.)
(disappointed)
(entering, carrying a newspaper)
(Hands him the newspaper.)
(on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! (Listens) Yes were surprised! (Listens)
(knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
(slowly turning and glaring at her)
(grabbing her coat)
(Shuts off the TV.)
(entering)
(Monica and Ross are shocked.)
(laughs)
(Picks up the phone and starts reading from the script.)
(Hangs up the phone.)
(Pause)
(Sees that hes not here and starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beers still cold. Something terrible mustve happened here! (He decides its not that important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)
(entering with Monica)
(To Monica)
(She goes to the attic.)
(They walk over to them.)
(Finds a pack of cigarettes.)
(He puts them in his pocket as Ross finds something of interest in one of his boxes.)
(reading his grades) Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym(He puts it away and finds something else.)
(He throws it back into the box as Mr. Geller moves a tarp and makes a discovery.)
(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips apart.)
(on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies Id like to talk to you about your toner needs. (Shes reading from the script.)
(doesnt have any luck)
(He looks at his board in his office that reads, "Todays Tasks: KILL SELF.")
(To the people standing around his cubicle.) Hey everybody! Uh, Im gonna kill myself! (Theres no response; no one even looks up.) Ill get back to ya. (To Phoebe) I got nothing. Wait. (He sets the phone down.) Uh, hey Marge! (Mimes putting a gun to his head, pulling the trigger, and splattering his brain on the wall behind him. Then points to himself. Marge watches this, then goes back to work.) (To Phoebe)
(He runs out the door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)
(The audiences laughter at Chandlers progress cuts out the rest of Rachels line.)
(He goes to remove the back, but it doesnt come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.)
(interrupting her)
(She sits down in the chair.)
(angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads for her room.)
(He picks up one of those art projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.)
(He picks up a trophy)
(grabbing a glove)
(grabbing a beer out of the chairs fridge)
(He flips up his armrest in disgust.)
(quietly)
(One of her coworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didnt mean him.)
(walking past Earls desk)
(laughs)
(Hangs up.)
(walking by and overhearing that) (to the rest of the staff)
(overacting)
(overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.)
(wary)
(Pointing to the boxes they just created for her.)
(Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding it up.)
(looking through it)
(Grabs it and examines it.)
(holding up a glove)
(Picking up a shirt.) I cant believe I even fit into this shirt! (She holds it up and it reads: Tyrannosaurus Ross.) (She turns it around and looks at it.) Oh, this is yours. (Hands it to Ross.)
(holding up a small cowboy hat) This isnt mine. (Sets it down and looks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isnt, this isnt my stuff! Ugh, Ross! (Grabs and holds up a doll.)
(Pause)
(Storms out.)
(To Ross) Screw it! Im having one. (Takes out and lights a cigarette.)
(excitedly)
(Which is an actual product by the way, Im not sure about the 3000 part.)
(Laughs)
(Heads for Joey and Rachels.)
(Sits down in it and groans.)
(sarcastic)
(Joey starts to get up.)
(Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel)
(to Marge)
(screaming)
(goes over to his desk)
(exhales)
(Thinks.)
(She holds out her arm.)
(inspecting it)
(To All) Did you hear that?! I dont need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! (Laughs as everyone ignores him.) (To Phoebe)
(To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl)
(She picks up some kind of furry thing.) It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I dont even know what it is! Ohh, its still soft. (She rubs it against her cheek.)
(entering)
(He hands her a small box.)
(opening it)
(shocked)
(even more shocked)
(To Monica)
(To Rachel)
(entering)
(Runs out.)
(entering from her room)
(To Monica)
(To Joey) they still look pretty damn good. (Joey smiles and everyone glares at him.)
(screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! (He buries his head in Phoebes lap for comfort.)
(screaming) And now Chandler! Were all gettin so old! (Looking up) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)
(They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head into Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)
(To Rachel)
(giddy)
(To Phoebe, quietly)
(To Ross)
(Phoebe hops in.)
(Shuts the car off.)
(getting out)
(Phoebe pulls out a hair from the back of her head)
(glares at him)
(To Joey)
(frustrated)
(To Chandler)
(To Mr. Geller) And you! I cant believe that you would have a tux thats thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Gellers shoulder.)
(He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
(entering)
(Rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)
(getting up to investigate)
(Giggles.)
(Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and Joeys doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment. She manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. (Pause)
(Pause)
(Kisses him.)
(laughing)
(Breathes on him.)
(The car moves an inch and Ross runs to the back of the car.) Okay, backStop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to the front.)
(To Joey)
(The woman walks away.)
(running up) Okay. Okay, heres what were gonna do. Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel. She inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!! (Runs off.)
(Hands her the hippity-hop.)
(She closes the door.)
(Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)
(sarcastic) Right! Okay. (Hands Phoebe her births certificate.)
(reading the certificate)
(sarcastic)
(Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller whos sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller whos standing next to him.)
(Starts to get up.)
(stopping him)
(sees someone)
(correcting her)
(Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay, (catches her)
(Giggles.)
(To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe)
(To Rachel)
(Starts for Monicas room, but Chandler stops him.)
(handing his to her)
(opening it) A scooter! (Shes not happy.)
(to Tag)
(Kisses him.)
(To Rachel)
(Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! Its better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying)
(crying)
(Runs into her room crying.)
(Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.)
(Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To Chandler)
(Removes two candles from the cake)
(To Chandler)
(To Monica)
(to a waiter) Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? (The waiter comes over)
(to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods)
(To Monica)
(Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)
(To Monica)
(clinking two glasses together)
(filming this)
(Backs away anyhow.)
(screaming)
(Pause) Yknow what Id really like to say? Im drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.) Thats right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the camera out of his dads hands.) And guess what! Ive been drunk before! And Ive smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! Its all okay. Its okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming the fall.)
(To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)
(Looks up)
(Gets up and exits.)
(After she leaves.)
(Gets up and runs out.)
(She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and Joey passionately kisses her.)
(Phoebe walks away smiling.)
(interrupting her)
(They and try to lift the car, of course it doesnt raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)
(Runs off downstairs.)
(to Tag)
(They sit on the step.)
(Kisses her.)
(They hug.)
(entering, limping, and holding his arm) I dont like this anymore. (He sits down with them in pain.)
(crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in Rosss shoulder.)
(They run and jump in the car.)
(starting it)
(He drives off.)
(starting to cry)
(To Ross)
(crying)
(Winks in a spy-type manner.)
(entering, excited)
(seriously)
(to Monica and Rachel) Its winter, they are fewer people on the street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)
(Raises her hand towards Chandler.)
(Ross laughs unbelievably.)
(Clears Throat)
(They both look behind them.)
(Pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
(A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)
(The man gets up and leaves.)
(They both get up.)
(quietly)
(Breaking up)
(Grabs the phone)
(gasps)
(Jessica slaps her.)
(crying) Oh, my baby! (Hugs Dina, but moves Dinas head to her other shoulder so that shes the only one in the picture.)
(crying)
(to no one in particular)
(quickly)
(She throws her drink in his face.)
(She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just received.)
(handing Rachel the phone)
(checking the speed dial)
(Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isnt telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial)
(looking at the speed dial)
(showing Phoebe her phone)
(turning around and looking)
(She looks through the window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.)
(Rachel dials her phone and Phoebes bag starts to ring.) Oh, it does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebes handbag.)
(She answers the cute guys phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her phone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please. (To Phoebe, holding out both phones.)
(In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be (Happily) Hi! Its Rach (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachels hand, catches it, and answers it.)
(on phone) Hello? (Listens)
(To Rachel) Shhh! Im on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. Its umm, its umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe yknow after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. (Listens) Okay, well okay Ill see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)
(Exits.)
(interrupting)
(She walks away.)
(walking up)
(She throws her drink on a passing writer.)
(to him) Im having a conversation here! (To Joey)
(In a British accent.)
(shocked)
(Makes a few unintelligible noises.)
(interrupting)
(Joey is nodding.)
(He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)
(He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)
(Joey gets a snooty look on his face.) All right, its a little weird, but its getting better. (Joey is pleased.)
(impressed)
(Starts to cry.)
(Shes not buying it.)
(intrigued)
(She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.)
(Pause) So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the mans face. (She does so.)
(She takes her hands off his face.)
(He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
(She grabs the back of his neck and kisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)
(Hands her the phone.)
(To Rachel)
(laughs)
(Looks hopefully out the door.)
(Rachel exhales in amazement.)
(Realizes what Phoebe said.)
(turning and looking at Tom again)
(fake disappointment)
(Hands him the cell phone.)
(Exits and Phoebe checks him out.)
(whispering)
(screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monicas.)
(shrugs)
(entering with Rachel)
(Points to her cheek.)
(He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the apartment.)
(breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To Cecilia)
(Monica walks away angrily)
(Throws them out and closes the door.) (To Cecilia)
(notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in)
(Realizes what that means.)
(flipping to the last page)
(giggles) (To Ross)
(To Rachel)
(stands up)
(They clink glasses.)
(They move into kiss but; theyre stopped by Joey entering with a huge bandage wrapped around his head.)
(as Jessica)
(Does a hair flip)
(running out to Joey) That was so wonderful! (Hugs him)
(Joey nods in recognition.)
(Realizes.)
(This causes more laughter.)
(to Ben)
(running to the bathroom)
(He closes the door.)
(to Ben)
(nervous)
(Ben enters)
(To Rachel)
(He hugs and kisses him.)
(Ross exits.) Ahhh (Silence)
(Holds up a bottle of margarita mix.)
(returning with Joey)
(Points to her chest.)
(checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause)
(laughs)
(Does so.)
(To Monica)
(She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)
(Shes pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)
(Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some nice soft pillows under your head, Im gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And ImSit down(She sits down on the couch)
(Hes sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for Monica to rub.)
(She is waving her hand up and down her face. Shes thinking about the pencil mark.)
(looking at his mark)
(She gets the box out of her purse.)
(She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a story! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)
(Starts reading them.)
(entering)
(Holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)
(She grabs the left side of her torso.)
(She points to the right side of her torso.)
(Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." (Monica and Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nods her approval.)
(To Monica)
(The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the quarter trick with her as well.)
(Carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.)
(jumping up from behind her chair) Gotcha!! (Rachel jumps up startled.)
(To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the coffee table and Ben walks up.)
(from the kitchen)
(To Ben)Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.) No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben)
(mimicking her)
(To Monica)
(Holds up the warning label.)
(reading) "When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and" And then I cant think of a good word for right here. (He points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)
(Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)
(To Monica)
(answering the door)
(standing outside)
(He looks at his watch.)
(entering)
(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.)
(thinks)
(breaking the kiss)
(They kiss again.)
(Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)
(Notices that the TV is turned off.)
(Points.)
(Joey walks to Chandlers bag by getting as far away from Chandlers bed as possible.)
(pause)
(He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)
(To Chandler)
(To Monica)
(To Joey)
(Joey smiles.)
(Chandler glares at him.)
(To Monica)
(Points to Joey)
(Shuts up on Monicas glare.)
(Monica turns and looks at him)
(To Joey)
(To Monica)
(Walks out and slams the door.)
(In a college frat boy voice)
(entering from the kitchen)
(Goes and checks.)
(yelling from the bathroom)
(yelling from off camera)
(Runs out.)
(Holds up his plate)
(They hug.)
(He nods yes.)
(Ross has a sign on his back that reads Poop.) WhAh-ha! (Ross stops and turns.)
(To Ross)
(She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) Thats great. That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.)
(He runs over to Ben, but he runs past him and out the door.)
(She walks out into the hallway.)
(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)
(She runs over to him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)
(Phoebe and Joey nod.)
(Points to Monica and Joey)
(pausing for a rest next to the fridge)
(They kiss.)
(Groans and picks up a piece of food.)
(still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks her watch)
(reads the side affects)
(She hands him the paper.)
(To Monica)
(Hands back the paper.)
(He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter, scooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)
(noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street)
(exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.) (Calmly) So hi, Im uh, Im Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly waves.)
(Kristen crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what hes talking about.)
(To Ross)
(To Chandler) Excuse me? (Chandler does the shy thing again.)
(The box hes holding.)
(She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When shes gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler cant pick it up.)
(wearing a veil)
(To Rachel)
(Laughs) Im getting married in December. (Turns away not happy with herself.)
(To Monica)
(The dress) come in another color or (The store owner walks away.)
(checking her out)
(They shake hands.)
(Pause)
(He picks up a lamp.)
(Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers)
(The lamp hes holding.)
(She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, Ill grab this one. (He follows her upstairs.)
(To Phoebe)
(Holds up a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She passes out whistles to them.)
(To Rachel)
(coming back out)
(Checks another rack and another woman tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Dont crowd me! (Finds it) This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, its perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) Im sorry, this ones taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.)
(She blows the signal.)
(hearing the signal) Im coming! Im coming! (She takes off towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)
(Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What are you doing? (Rachel doesnt stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel wont stop so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)
(She starts to leave.)
(She grabs Rachels hand and drags her towards Monica.) Excuse me! Excuse me! (Shes knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)
(handing Phoebe the dress)
(seeing whos trapped)
(Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)
(He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)
(entering)
(returning)
(sarcastically shocked)
(Chandler laughs.)
(He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.)
(Exits.)
(not buying it)
(smiling)
(thinks)a slice(Thinks)
(Monica hands her one.)
(Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen here missy! (Listens) Wh(She is hung up on.)
(gasps)
(entering)
(To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.)
(Finds a receit.)
(Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.)
(Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (Runs his fingers across his forehead)
(He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)
(returning)
(entering)
(They shake hands.)
(Sits down.)
(laughs that one off)
(from the bedroom)
(She enters.)
(entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? (They ignore her.)
(without turning around)
(She heads for the bedroom.)
(Monica goes in the bedroom.) Yknow, she could use a little(Whistles that she needs to do what theyre doing.) (Something happens on the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)
(Joey looks at her.)
(Rachel returns from the bathroom.)
(gasps)
(Points to Rachel.)
(Gasps)
(to Joey)
(A student raises his hand.)
(He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesnt know what to make of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, thats uh, thats all for today. (Everyone starts to get up.)
(shocked)
(Points to the podium) and youre teaching and your face gets all seriousyou look so good. (In a sexy voice)
(Walks away from him.)
(Looks.)
(Points to her ring.)
(Leaves.)
(pretending to be an announcer) And the winner isJoey Tribbiani! (He then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a bottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didnt prepare a speech. But umm, Id like to thank (Rachel enters quietly)
(Joey is startled.)
(confused)
(Does it, youll have to see it.)
(Likes it.)
(Does that to Monica.)
(laughs)
(She starts to open up her blouse.)
(entering from her room)
(Rachel and Joey both look at him.)
(To Ross)
(They kiss.)
(Backs out the door.)
(Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.)
(yelling through the window to Phoebe)
(yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)
(Chandler approaches.)
(Holds up his finger.)
(To Rachel)
(Does it.)
(Applause), Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless (Applause), Dunkin Harrington from Passions (Applause), and Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives (Applause). And the Soapie goes to(She opens the envelope)
(Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and which is drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that hes on TV right now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)
(angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head in disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. (There is applause, which Joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest of the nominees), from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is(Opens the envelope)Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. (Applause) Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldnt be with us tonight so Ill be accepting this award on her behalf. (Realizes something) And Im sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. Shed also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel whos sittin right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone is turned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)
(He whips out the award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)
(He puts it up above the TV to display it.)
(looking at the award)
(Points to the TV)
(He sets the award down.)
(opening his door) If I cant have it you cant have it! (Rachel walks away angrily.)
(turning towards him)
(Goes back to writing on the board.)
(turning around and dragging the chalk down the board)
(Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guys cute. (Points to a guy sitting behind Monica.)
(Monica starts to leave.) Go tell Chandler! Hurry before its too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean putting out doesnt get you love? (Monica is shocked.)
(She coolly knocks on the door)
(coolly)
(Joey glares at her.)
(Hands it to her.)
(shocked) Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?! (She rolls her eyes and throws it onto the couch.)
(She exits.)
(To Rachel)
(As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase with flowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)
(Monica laughs.)
(They hug.)
(hoarsely)
(walking up)
(Ned looks shocked)Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You dont love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, Ill be right with you. (To Ned) Dont make this worse and Ill give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)
(Picks it up.)
(entering from her room)
(To an imaginary Neil Simon) Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. (Blows him a kiss.)
(To Joey)
(Joeys cell phone rings and he answers it.)
(to Monica and Phoebe)
(on phone)
(Listens) Oh. (Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)
(To Ross)
(entering)
(laughs)
(She goes into the guest bedroom.)
(To Phoebe)
(Giggles.)
(calmly)
(grabs and shakes Rachel)
(They sit down.)
(pause)
(Timidly)
(They both jump up to head for there room, but Monica stops.)
(transfixed)
(catching him)
(To Ross)
(Stares at Monicas eyes.)
(Starts to leave.)
(Laughs.)
(Joey glares at her.)
(Gets up for the phone.)
(entering)
(Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that wont work. Cheese? (Picks it up) That wont work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up)
(Runs out.)
(To Phoebe, after Monicas gone)
(Holds it up.)
(Holds up $40.)
(shocked at her beauty)
(hugs him)
(quietly)
(She laughs)
(She pulls her blouse open to show him her shoulder and bra strap.)
(looking then moving away quickly)
(To himself)
(The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of women.)
(To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to another pairing.)
(Goes over to Rachel.)
(to her)
(to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.)
(Points to it.) Umm, this one is made of bologna. (Points.)
(to a whole group)
(To a different group)
(Picks it up and throws it away.)
(Rubs it against her cheek.)
(in his head) Shes your cousin. Shes your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head shed think you were sick! (She grabs some popcorn.) Or would she? Lets back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logans Run, the sexiest movie ever. (She grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.)
(They sit back up.)
(in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay, doesnt have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will do. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause) There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To her) I-I, I uh havent had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his head)
(She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch.)
(Motions to the pile in the corner)
(He starts taking off his clothes.) I totally understand. You need to yknow make sure I dont have any horrible scars or tattoos. Dont you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands back up and looks down.) So there you go, thats me. (We cut to a camera angle looking at the casting director and movie director through Joeys legs.) One hundred percent natural! (Suddenly, theres a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is shocked.)
(Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping thing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official website at www.deniserichards.com.)
(noticing her)
(in her head)
(to Gunther)
(Points.)
(Gunther goes and gets them.)
(to the gang)
(Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams)
(screaming)
(Turns and looks at the gang whos staring)Why dont I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)
(Grabs Rachels hand and notices that she doesnt have a ring on it.) (Sadly)
(excitedly)
(Gunther returns with her cigarettes.) Oh, there you are. (Takes them from Gunther.) (To Rachel) Umm, so listen, just call me. Heres my card. (Hands the card over.)
(Reading the card)

(Joins the rest of the gang.)
(excitedly)
(To Monica)
(excitedly)
(To Joey)
(telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where the band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have peoples names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachels place.)
(Grabs her pin) and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs. Monica just glares at her.)
(To Chandler)
(To Rachel)
(entering)
(Stares at her.)
(Gets up) Lets see, wellif this is the wedding hall then umm (Walks away)
(looking around)
(leaning down to her)
(Jumps back and walks away.)
(motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a few)
(sees another rack)
(Points to the tuxedos.)
(reading a tag)
(Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux)
(Worried.)
(Moves another piece.)
(Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joeys like in Checkers.)
(entering)
(Joey nods yes.)
(excitedly)
(laughs)
(Laughs then seriously)
(To Joey)
(Joey smiles and nods lewdly.)
(shocked)
(Holding up his garment bag.)
(looking at him)
(He dials the phone and hands it to Monica.)
(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah Im just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent werent delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey gives her a thumbs up.)
(Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh)
(Phoebe agrees by grunting.)
(changing the subject)
(shocked)
(Pause)
(Runs into the bedroom.)
(entering)
(Rapping)
(To Chandler)
(standing up)
(trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket)
(Grabs the invitation and reads it.)
(Hands him the jacket and walks away.)
(entering)
(defeated)
(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head)
(To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I dont think Ill be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, yknow youve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.)
(She does so.) Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and Im not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you dont remember that, maybe you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)
(shocked)
(Phoebe is shocked.) I just didnt want to tell you cause I didnt think that youd return my love, and now that you have (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)
(moving away)
(Goes in again.)
(moves away again)
(suddenly frightened)
(laughs) Oh you dont have to be (Laughs again) sorry. ImIm obviously kidding. Im not in love with you. (To Phoebe) Im not in love with her. I dont hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I dontpicture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Ehkiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab and drives off.)
(yelling from the changing room)
(Chandler enters.)
(Laughs)
(handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Lets just do it right now. Okay? It wont be hard. Just say whats in your heart. (She goes back, sits down, and starts feverishly writing.)
(watching in her) (in his head)
(writing) Monica, there are no words (To Joey and Ross)
(To Ross)
(Shows them what shes been working on.)
(Points.)
(Points.)
(Monica glares at her.)
(seeing her)
(They all try to think about one example and dont succeed.)
(She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out theres more than three)
(shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one)
(She realises what that couldve meant.)
(Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)
(writing)
(writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on)
(trapped)
(throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
(She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
(She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
(She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
(Starting to cry.)
(He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.)
(yelling through the door)
(Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)
(shocked)
(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)
(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica)
(on phone)
(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
(on phone)
(She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.)
(screaming)
(entering)
(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)
(Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)
(She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
(after they've left)
(Hangs up.)
(She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.)
(Joey just shakes his head.)
(He does a little mimic of her dance.)
(entering the hall)
(To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
(Examining the dress.)
(Pause)
(She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.)
(swallowing hard)
(Pause)
(They walk together and hug.)
(They kiss.)
(He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.)

(Gets up and leaves.)
(Gets in.)
(She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off of the hood.)
(She starts the car.) Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesnt find it.)
(She starts off.)
(grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)
(She goes to get it.)
(stopping her)
(He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh. (Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)
(laughs)
(They shake hands.)
(He bends over to open his bag, when he does so his pants slide down his butt revealing a pink lace secret.)
(She sets a bag down in front of him.)
(Monica just looks at him.)
(Laughs.)
(Phoebe nods.)
(shocked)
(She takes her hands off of the wheel.)
(grabbing the wheel)
(She starts to pull over.)
(to Chandler and Monica)
(To Chandler) She? (To the waiter)
(To Chandler)
(Pounds the table.)
(Walks away.)
(The show starts.)
(She tries to switch places with him and goes under his leg.)
(sexily)
(handing it to him)
(She holds the mike out to the audience.)
(singing) For Im loved by a pretty wonderful boy! (Applause.) Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars. (He starts going into the audience.)
(Chandler exhales and turns off the table light.)
(standing at a table and asking the guy sitting there)
(Holds out the mike.)
(to Chandlers back) Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face. (He slowly turns around. Helena recognizes him.)
(He sits down next to her.)
(He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe that hes got panties on.)
(He mimed that and stops when he realized he went to far.)
(resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
(To Monica)
(Noticing Monicas ring.) Ooh, what is this sparkle something! (Shows the audience who woos.)
(looks at Chandler)
(disappointed) I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. (To a bald guy.)
(Looks at Monica who nods.)
(Goes back on stage.)
(To Chandler)
(Four guys wearing rubber boots, shorts, hats, and nothing else carrying umbrellas run onto the stage.) (Singing)
(To Monica)
(They pull over.)
(Rachel laughs.)
(laughs)
(He grabs Rosss license.) Ill be right back with your ticket. (Walks back to his car.)
(pause)
(He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and goes to talk to her.)
(to the woman)
(He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with it. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman)
(Monica looks at her.) Oh! (Realizes.)
(checking her watch) Op! We gotta go! (The girls stand up.)
(Joey stands up.)
(They all exit.)

(smiling)
(Pause)
(entering)
(Rachel pauses as she thinks.)
(He runs out.)
(approaching)

(approaching)
(He walks off.)
(He is spitting on the hard Ps and Ts.)
(wiping his face)
(still spitting)
(wipes face)
(glances at Richard) No. Nope, I uhI thI thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Yknow? Hes uh, hes a face toucher. (Behind his back, Richard is nodding no.)
(Walks off.)
(Joey backs away and wipes his face again.)
(entering from the bedroom)
(laughs)
(Chandler just looks at her.)
(voice on answering machine)
(They hug.)
(Walks away.)
(walks up)
(The girls all laugh.) What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass! (The laugh harder.)
(He walks away angrily.)
(They hug.) (Shes wearing a tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)
(He freaks out and loosens the tie again.)
(shaking her hand)
(shaking her hand)
(points)
(entering)

(Everyone does so.)
(Monica goes into the bathroom.)
(To Phoebe)
(He starts to leave.)
(Exits.)
(going up to Rachels closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and looks inside and doesnt see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still doesnt find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)
(He hands her the note.)
(reading the note)
(walking up) Whats up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads it.) Tell Monica Im sorry. (Pause)
(Joey and Rachels apartment)
(pointing at Ross)
(scared)
(Hes holding a script.)
(Spits on the t)
(wiping face)
(Reading from the script) Picture? What picture? (He pauses then spits)
(Walks away slowly, but notices something.) Mom?! Dad?! (Theyre sitting by the window.)
(She waves at Gunther who waves back.)
(shocked)
(pause) Because Vincent, we were lovers. (Pause)
(To Joey)
(Spits.) Important plans! (Spits on the Ps.)
(closing the door)
(entering from her room, excitedly) Im getting married today!!! (She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I dont care because todays my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)
(re-entering) Im gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her room.)
(She drags her into the bathroom.)
(Looking around)
(Looks.)
(Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.)
(looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)
(finding something interesting in the trash can)
(Rachel covers her mouth.)
(She throws the test back into the trash.)
(Starts to leave.)
(jumping up)
(The director turns around.)
(Starts to walk away.)

(Gets up.)
(Phoebe sticks her head and motions that they found Chandler)
(entering)
(To Joey)
(He brings his sword back and drops it, causing it to fly over the wall.)
(starting to cry)
(on phone)
(Chandler panics.)
(Starts to leave)
(To Rachel)
(They turn the corner.)
(The happy couple emerges.) Congratulations. (To the best man and maid of honor) Mazel Tov! (The rabbi emerges.) Hi! Oh, great hat. (Hes wearing an interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.)
(To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.)
(pause)
(He stands up, staggers to the couch, and starts to lie down.)
(Joey picks him up in a firemans carry and carries him out.)
(Hes looking at Joeys.)
(turning a corner)
(He starts to get up.)
(Chandler lies back down.)
(standing up)
(He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.)
(Hugs him.)
(His dad clears his throat.) You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) Im so glad you here. (He kisses his mom.)
(They stop and she kisses Monica on the cheek.)
(He kisses her and they sit down.)
(Her dress.)
(To Chandler)
(in Monicas ear)
(leaning in)
(entering) Thats my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, Im sorry Im a little late. You may be confused by this now, (Hes still in costume) but you wont be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, lets get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.)
(To Rachel)
(She turns back to Chandler.)
(To Ross) No, thats okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way its okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if Im sure? (He leans in and kisses her.)

(To Ross)
(Quietly)
(Doug exits.) Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.)
(Stops when she realizes it was her.)
(entering) Hi Rachel? Im Dr. Schiff. (By the way, hes an attractive man.)

(Doug looks at him.)
(Motions that theyre connected.) So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you. And I mean-Im having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there isnt.)

(Rachel just looks at him.)
(laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.)

(Looks at his still deformed hand)
(They both look at him.)
(Grabs a bottle of water from a student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay, why dont we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23.

(But for a totally different reason.)
(He moves to the map and we see why he made it to class on time, hes wearing in-line skates and hasnt taken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on the skates and points to the map.) Here. (China.)

(To herself)

(To Monica)
(Pause)
(from outside the bathroom)
(sarcastically)
(entering the bathroom)
(Looks down)
(checking for herself) (To Monica)
(entering) Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? (Looks at Chandler) Oh, my! (Covers the spot where Joey wants bubbles to be replaced.)

(thinking)
(entering)
(thinking)
(To herself)
(opens the door wearing a robe, but leaves the chain on)
(Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)

(laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)
(She storms out.)
(Off Phoebes look)Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)
(Back to the matter at hand)
(crying) I hope youre a better father than youre a friend!! (Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)
(bursts into the room)
(She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)
(Drops the sheet.)
(looking down)
(They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)
(The secret green door by the bathroom.)
(Tries the door.)
(He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)
(walking casually away)
(entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica)
(Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said, "If it helps!" (Goes to the bedroom.)
(He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs Rachels belly.)
(Mimics him)
(Rubbing his belly)
(calling from her room)
(in a soothing voice) Great, lets begin. (She starts the massage.)
(in a sexy voice)
(getting uncomfortable)
(Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh thats it! Thats it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh (Covers both ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)
(Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)
(He walks away and into his apartment and looks the door.)
(Winces in pain.)
(Rachel grabs his hand.)
(Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey)
(seeing Ross)
(rushes in)
(Ross lets her go.)
(To Joey)
(To Joey) Uh, if you have any questions, heres some information on Braxton-Hicks. (Hands Joey a pamphlet.)
(Grabs Ross around the shoulders.)
(Checks his hair.)
(Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I justI wish I didnt feel this way about Rachel anymore, yknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkI think Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosss face. (Pause)
(They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.)
(Pause) Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the door.)
(Laughs.)
(Sexily) Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?! (Pause)
(To the guy)
(Takes a bite out of the sandwich and starts to get sick.)
(Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
(to Rachel)
(Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)
(entering)
(Gasps)
(To Rachel)
(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)
(They hug and Joey breathes a sigh of relief.)
(He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see whats behind the green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.)
(entering) (Gasps)
(laughs)
(Chandler starts singing the theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.)
(Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)
(She stops when she realizes what shes doing.)
(to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee)
(Rachel exits with coffee)
(sighs)
(to Joey)
(reading the label)
(entering with something behind her back)
(holds up two ermrevealing articles of clothing)
(quietly)
(knocking and entering)
(Phoebe goes into the hall and brings a dog inside!)
(to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! (the dog sticks his head between Joeys legs)
(from her bedroom)
(picking up a video from the table) Candy and Cookie. Candy and Cookie? Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some "porn") (A woman on TV breaths hard)
(The woman groans, moans, grunts, and screams. Chandlers eyes get huge!)
(Chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control, frantically.)
(Joey pretends to throw it, but really doesnt, and the dog goes running off.) Well, youre cute, but youre not too smart! (The dog returns with a ball that looks exactly like the same one Joey has.)
(looking at the ball the dog brought back)
(entering)
(looks at the dog and gasps)
(talking with a higher voice, and puckered lipskind of like you do to a baby or...wella puppyits hard to explain. Just use your imagination!) Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but Ive got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. (still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously cant stop it. (exits)
(to the dog) Cmere. Hey. Cmere. Thats Rachel. Shes the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with youwe love her. But we cant have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? Youre a guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks)
(entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit) (Chandler glances up at Monica with his mouth still wide open and his eyes still huge)
(to herself)
(pointing at the video)
(pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, its about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer)
(picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like hes going to throw up!)
(puts his hand on her leg)
(they hug)
(Mona laughs)
(laughing)
(she laughs again)
(not amused)
(Mona laughsyesagain!) (Ross fake laughs, obviously not finding this funny, and hes starting to panic, so he shoves the whole saltwater taffy hes eating in his mouth)
(with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head and starts to break down)
(Ross hands her one)
(Referring to the taffy, which shes been chewing this whole time.) Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? Whats the deal? (she swallows it, finally)
(entering)
(the dog doesnt move) Youre subdued. (to Joey)
(pause) Oh, me, right! (Joey follows Phoebe into the kitchen)
(picks up the ball) Heres your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces right next to the dog)
(There is a knock on the door.)
(runs to her room to get her money)
(opening the door to see Mona standing there)
(he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of like)
(entering)
(to Ross)
(exits to her room)
(Doorbell rings)
(exits)
(fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)
(entering)
(as Ross enters with a present)
(handing Mona the present)
(Chandler takes the tape and sticks it under the chair cushion)
(Chandler crawls over to Monica and they move in to kiss, but they cant do it and back up. They move in to kiss again, and kiss very awkwardly for a second, until someone knocks on the door.)
(entering)
(Monica and Chandler both look at each other and run over to the window to watch the action in Ross apartment)
(with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down)
(watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming)
(Monica and Rachel both cover their eyes)
(Two girls sitting at a table next to them look up in disgust, and Ross and Joey move away)
(they do)
(placing a cup in front of Ross)
(walks towards the door until)
(Ross just stands in the doorway, for like a minuteAhh! Whats going to happen next??!!! I cant make it all the way through the Olympics!!!)
(thinking) Youre going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, youre going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! (Rachel puts the tape in the VCR)
(Music starts playingyesyou know what kind of music)
(thinking)
(voiceover)
(closes the door)
(startled)
(Starts to leave.)
(stops)
(Puts his hand on her belly.)
(Pulls his hand away.)
(entering)
(To Chandler)
(To Rachel) You dont think theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)
(To Phoebe)
(Pause)
(Pause)
(Shakes Chandlers hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monicas hand.)
(mouths to Chandler)
(mouths to Phoebe)
(cough talks)
(Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still theres staring.)
(returning)
(Walks away and Chandler glares at Phoebe.)
(getting worried)
(Starts to leave.)
(Enters.)
(pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uhI am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)
(He takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.)
(He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys another sip.)
(They both laugh, and Chandler tries to but fails.)
(Breathlessly)
(disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe)
(Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as Rachel opens the door and startles him.)
(Walks away.)
(Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles Joey again.)
(mimics Don)
(Monica doesnt look impressed.)
(Joey is staring at the table.)
(Exhales slowly)
(They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)
(Turns away, then turns back) Seconds up! (Joey glares at him.) Notthat kind of table. (He walks away.)
(stunned)
(looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, youre kidding! Oh, its a joke! (Laughs.) Its funny. Its funny. I dont get it. (Joey doesnt say any thing and Rachel realizes its not a joke.) Oh. (Pause)
(Long pause as Rachel says nothing.)
(Hangs his head down.)
(Stands up.)
(Starts to cry.)
(Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to her.)
(Hug him.)
(They hug again.)
(Pause) I kinda hope its the girl. (The other waiter is shocked.)
(hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate)
(Turns to run to the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Dont eat that! (Runs to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)
(To Monica)
(Opens the sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)
(Exits and Joey enters.)
(To Joey)
(Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler)
(incredulous)
(Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) Whoa! (Stops.)
(interrupting him)
(Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book)
(stunned)
(Reads the leaves)
(Checking the book)
(Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, Im gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And hes gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)
(entering)
(Walks away.)
(noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a second you guysfor the last couple weeks Ive been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe hes the tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)
(Looking at his tea.)
(To Chandler)
(off Monicas look)
(entering)
(To Chandler) Yknow what, if were gonna make dinner were gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)
(Awkward silence.)
(Pause)
(Pause)
(Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and the exchange information.)
(Theres no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter Monas apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)
(entering, with her date)
(Hands him Rosss shirt.)
(Ross mouths, "Its salmon!")
(entering)
(a little freaked out)
(looks at his crotch)
(Gets up and walks out.)
(singing) The sunll come outtomorrow! Betyour bottom dollar that tomorrow (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice)
(entering)
(worried)
(To Joey)
(Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)
(seeing Ross)
(She does so.)
(Motions for him to continue.)
(Exits smugly.)
(Looks up)
(She points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)
(To Phoebe) Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s(looks at Phoebe.)
(She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe)
(to the clerk)
(looking around)
(Goes into the bedroom.)
(on phone) Item J437-A, color: winterberry. (Theres a knock on the door as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in. (She does so.) Im so-so sorry about yesterday. I-Im really sorry. Its just that I (He picks up the pink shirt.)
(interrupting him)
(faking starting to cry)
(She picks up the shirt Ross has just set down.)
(laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)
(Sits up)
(To Ross)
(Points to himself) Im an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)
(Makes funny faces trying to cry)
(Hands him a picture.)
(Pause)
(picking up Chi-Chis picture)
(Points as he says their names) Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, Im sorry Phoebe didnt mention you. (Chandler makes a face)
(laughs) Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I? (Puts hand on her stomach)
(To Chandler)
(Kisses his mom.)
(Looking a toothpick)
(To Ross and Rachel)
(Hands them a check)
(looking at the check)
(He takes a mental picture of them all.)
(Punches Chandler in the arm and he makes a face of pain.)
(imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry(He looks behind him then notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)
(Walks off)
(Hits Rosss chest)
(Pulls Rachel off to the side)
(Bounces the plates)
(Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while dropping it on the floor)
(Punches the air)
(To Ross)
(makes a fist)
(Pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) When I look around this room, Im-Im saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she cant because shes dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember shes dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didnt see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits for people to cry, but doesnt get any tears.)
(looking at the picture)
(She turns around and smiles)
(crying)
(Sits down) My God this is the most comfortable couch Ive ever sat on in my entire life. (Bounces on couch)
(Giggles)
(He exits and she slams the door behind him.)
(Closes door)
(Rachel laughs)
(starts to cry)
(She hands the magazine to Joey.)
(reading)
(She has her hand on his shoulder.)
(Joey nods his agreement.)
(Excited) Ha-ha! Im gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.)
(To Chandler)
(Out of the sides of their mouths.)
(To Joey)
(laughs)
(entering)
(Sits back in relief.)
(interrupting him)
(The gang shake their heads.) Yknow a mento, a role model. (Chandler bites his fist to keep from talking.)
(Sets down a huge plate of muffins in front of Joey.)
(To the interviewer)
(The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)
(interrupting him) Hi! Im gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, Im the one you come too. This might be Joeys baby (rubbing her stomach), who knows? Im just kiddingSeriously, (leans into the cassette recorder Shelley is using)
(leaning into the recorder as well)
(She takes her coffee mug up to the counter.)
(returning)
(scoffs at him) Yeah, thats gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I(leans into the microphone again)
(In an Australian accent)
(They resume their previous positions.)
(Puts bracelet on Joey) it's about you and me and the fact that we're (Reading bracelet)
(He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
(He picks it up and eats it.)
(kisses Joey)
(grunting)
(Chandler and Ross look at each other.)
(to Phoebe)
(to her friend)
(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)
(Points at him.)
(points)
(in the Joey voice)
(Joey backs away frightened.)
(Gives her the Joey-love look.)
(They shake hands.)
(The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the gang.)
(returning)
(The interviewer leaves.)
(Winks at him.)
(entering)
(interrupting her)
(Pause)
(Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs. Green.) (To Phoebe)
(on phone)

(to Ross)
(gestures to his not understanding mother)
(getting up) Oh, for gods sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) Im sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didnt even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings)
(on phone)
(to Chandler and Monica)
(to Joey)
(returns)
(waves to the bar)
(both get up)
(the Bings leave, the waiter comes)
(all the food is served)
(with birthday cake, singing)
(picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again)
(in her apartment, screaming)
(yawning)
(clearly not so interested)
(Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)
(Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)
(Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)
(in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)
(in a flash she answers)
(He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not... that's gum. (He digs in a little more.)
(impatient)
(He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking for. A key.)
(really surprised)
(he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from her bag.)
(Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)
(sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)
(in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)
(they're standing up and make their way to the door)
(she starts playing with her hair)
(and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross crumples up the application form)
(They sit down and Rachel sighs)
(indignant)
(he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.)
(Ross opens the door.)
(a guy)
(gasps)
(excited)
(David thinks for a while)
(Phoebe seems very charmed) Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone? (Phoebe is still up on a cloud from what David just said)
(points at herself)
(sarcastically)
(angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)
(Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.)
(Doesn't believe what she's hearing)
(laughs, but then moves to Phoebe)
(and she walks away)
(Monica laughs)
(Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)
(to Phoebe)
(Ross has got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)
(Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)
(skeptic)
(on a yeah, right tone)
(Ross and Rachel look puzzled) That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in... (points at his heart, but starts to cry before he can finish his sentence. Rachel tries to comfort him, but Ross has this "you've got to be kidding me" look all over him)
(In the other room Emma starts to cry.)
(Sandy leaves for Emma's room)
(she's got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face)
(it makes Rachel smile)
(whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" gesture)
(He gets emotional again and waves his hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears)
(Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.)
(Can't believe what he hears)
(Chandler has really big eyes, and nods)
(stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)
(sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says "you're welcome" without a sound)
(David holds Phoebe and wants to kiss her.)
(they go sit on the couch)
(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door)
(David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)
(They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)
(in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross)
(very worried)
(wipes his tears again)
(Rachel looks at Ross in a "why do you say that" manner)
(to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)
(picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)
(speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie)
(takes a careful bite from the cookie)
(There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)
(David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)
(he looks as if he doesn't want to believe what's happening)
(points to David)
(looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)
(looks surprised)
(Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.)
(he can't come up with anything)
(he just can't seem to grasp it)
(the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)
(Joey makes a gesture and sound like "Can you believe that?")
(Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)
(again they laugh, even more fake than before)
(they all burst out in a thundering laugh)
(Monica wipes away tears)
(they realise it wasn't a joke)
(Chandler turns to Joey)
(Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)
(Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)
(he laughs)
(He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross "What are you doing?)
(he points at Mike)
(he hits David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight using their fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)
(they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him)
(points at Mike)
(Makes a move to kiss her.)
(to Mike) Take good care of her. (and he leaves)
(They kiss... The door opens and David comes in again.)
(gives Mike a business card) We'll uhm... we'll party up Vladnik style. (He leaves again)
(he puts his fingers in position on the recorder)
(looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to God...! (Joey is in shock)
(He winks to Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that and kind of angrily says...)
(and makes a "there" nod to Ross)
(shakes his head)
(Ross goes to the kitchen)
(sighs)
(Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)
(In a puppet voice)
(kind of emotional)
(Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)
(he leaves the apartment)
(to Monica)
(Ross walks to the couch where Sandy sits)
(surprised)
(from behind the bedroom door)
(from bedroom)
(Ross hesitates) Please...? (he tilts his head)
(Sandy tilts his head again)
(and shakes his head)
(from the bedroom)
(Ross now starts to cry)
(baby talk) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up) Come here gorgeous. (puts her on his knees and talks to her) Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But you've got... (in a softer voice) You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the B's) Big baby butt! I like big butts. (raps) I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get...(Emma laughs) Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...(raps) My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon... (Emma laughs again and Ross looks worried)
(realises that anyone could have overheard that)
(laughs) Yeah! Right! (points at Monica) People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird." (laughs again) Or... or maybe just a wing or... (realises...)
(looks at Chandler)
(very excited)
(imitating Monica)
(Rachel gasps)
(sarcastically)
(she holds up two 'Phoebe' dresses, Rachel and Monica look at them... taking their time, don't wanting to hurt Phoebe)
(Monica looks at Rachel in disbelief)
(speaking louder and articulating) That's she's like the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears) Listen! (Monica looks at Phoebe in a duh! way)
(in disbelief)
(Ross tries to impersonate Emma's laugh, but it comes out very squeaky, very high pitched. He laughs about himself but then looks at Rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.)
(excited)
(Rachel gasps) well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back... (Rachel's face changes from excited to angry)
(disgusted)
(Joey and Chandler both realise what she's assuming and start laughing.)
(laughs) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey looks around)
(Joey sits down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants)
(Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by Richard's video collection)
(realises) Wait a minute... This says Monica... (looks around) And this is Richard's apartment... (realises some more)
(Joey gasps and finally understands...)
(Mike kisses her on the cheek. A butler walks in and takes Phoebe's coat.)
(Mike's parents walk in)
(in a very posh accent)
(no accent)
(accent)
(accent)
(no accent) Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit surreal, which Phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again)
(Phoebe punches Theodore right in the stomach)
(Theodore grabs his stomach in agony)
(Theodore walks out... Mike walks towards Phoebe)
(Mike walks away and Bitsy walks in the same direction.)
(Mike now enters and stands behind Phoebe)
(Bitsy walks away)
(sighs) Well, we know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey enters the apartment)
(laughs nervously)
(backs off)
(Chandler turns his back to the TV. Joey puts the tape in the VCR, switches it on and watches what's on the tape... It's clearly a american football match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...)
(Chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the TV and a moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in size...) What the... (Chandler turns around, but Joey already took a sprint for Chandler, jumps, and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...)
(at this moment Monica comes home, and sees Chandler flat on his back on the floor and Joey pinning him down)
(Monica hears the moaning coming from the TV and looks at it) Oh my God, is that Richard? (It only takes a split second for Joey to realise, he pulls Monica down by her jacket, and she falls, face down next to Chandler. Chandler gets up a bit, and Joey quickly covers Chandler's eyes with his hand.)
(Rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... No response from Emma...) Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... (Rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... (Rachel's face is telling "Oh what am I doing? The things I have to go through... and she starts to rap) I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (Emma starts to laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! (Rachel now really gets into it, and her insecure movements start getting better) I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo... (Rachel picks up Emma and Ross now enters)
(sighs)
(The butler serves dinner)
(she cuts the meat, picks it up with her fork and holds it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to overcome her vegetarian thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... Clearly not enjoying the meat...) Hmmm... yummy (everybody seems okay with it, except Mike. He's making a hmmmm.... face... Then Phoebe swallows it) Hmmm... (at first she likes it, but then, in an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. You hear a door slamming.)
(looks at his parents, which look in disgust)
(pauses)
(laughs) Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... (Monica keeps looking at Joey) Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later. (Joey walks out)
(she turns on the video again)
(Chandler's expression changes)
(Mike walks in)
(Phoebe almost enters the room, but she hears the discussion and waits and evesdrops next to the door-opening.)
(Phoebe overheard what Michael said and now enters the room)
(he walks to Phoebe)
(they kiss)
(accent)
(Rachel slaps Ross's butt on the beat)
(Phoebe, Mike, Chandler, Monica and Joey step in)
(Then Ross turns around and sees their friends standing in the doorway)
(She also turns and sees the gang)
(Monica walks in)
(Joey walks in)
(Chandler walks away to store the box of broken china.)
(Chandler walks back, looking angrily at Joey)
(looks down)
(Pause)
(pause)
(She laughs. He stares for a moment.) Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, (points to Ross) that happened. (points to Emma.)
(They pause and exchange a glance. Then, Ross looks away.)
(spotting Rachel's dress)
(to Ross)
(to Mike)
(Holds up a six pack of Foster's Lager)
(They sit.)
(pause)
(pause)
(pause)
(pause) That's okay. We'll talk about (pause) something else. (They pause. They drink.)
(Mike nods. Another pause.)
(Hangs his jacket over the suitcase, locks the door, then turns to Monica.)
(They kiss.)
(hushed)
(pause)
(He knocks.)
(He sees her in her negligee.)
(As Chandler)
(pause. He looks over her shoulder at the table with the wine.)
(She clinks his glass and pulls back.) Okay, buh-bye. (She closes the door.)
(He raises his hands in front of himself, sticks out his behind, and wiggles it.)
(He answers it, holding it out so that Monica can hear too.)
(He walks to the hallway.)
(outside the apartment door)
(softly)
(listens at the door.) No. (pause)
(writhes as if in agony)
(looking at his watch) Eleven minutes. (long pause)
(pause)
(nods)
(sighs)
(with tray and two drinks)
(to Phoebe)
(Monica tips her head slightly as if asking "Did you hear yourself?")
(pause)
(pause)
(They start to walk away.)
(She pulls a business card from her purse and writes on it.)
(Reading the card.)
(The guys leave.)
(lowers voice to imitate Ross) "Yeah." (Clears throat.)
(as herself)
(as Ross) "Yeah." (Clears throat twice.) "Me neither." (Clears throat again.)
(as herself)
(as Ross) "Yeah. That works for me." (Clears throat twice more.)
(whining)
(pointing)
(She turns to find Bill, but they have gone.)
(imitating Rachel) "Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone." (smiles)
(releases a whoosh of air)
(In the hall, relieved)
(calling from the bar on her cell phone.)
(to Rachel)
(Phoebe gives Rachel the phone.)
(She takes the phone from Rachel.)
(Phoebe gives the thumbs-up sign to Rachel.)
(knowingly chuckles)
(putting his arm up with his hand on the door frame.) Why? (He starts to lower his arm.)
(Entering the apartment)
(whining)
(pause)
(gasp)
(She slaps Chandler.)
(He checks the bathroom shaking the bat. Then he proceeds to their bedroom.)
(To Monica)
(smiling)
(emerging)
(sniffing the air and then Monica.)
(sniffing Joey)
(sniffs his shirt.)
(pointing at Joey)
(suddenly starts issuing him out)
(spots the suitcase just inside the door where Chandler left it)
(thinks, then turns to Monica)
(He lunges across Ross's lap on the sofa to reach the phone. Ross stares at him with wide eyes.) Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking. (pause. Hands phone to Ross)
(takes the phone, but speaks to Mike)
(He strikes himself in the head with the bat. He stands dazed for a moment.)
(His eyes bug out.)
(pause)
(taps chandler on the arm)
(She kisses him.)
(Joey and Chandler exit to the hall. Joey pulls out the tickets and hands one to Chandler.)
(He hugs Rachel)
(He hugs Phoebe.)
(pause)
(She and Mike exit.)
(She closes the door.)
(She exits to the hallway and closes the door behind her.)
(nods)
(listens) Ah, no, she's not here right now. Can I take a message? (grabs a pad and pen) Bill from the bar? (writes)
(She goes to tend Emma.)
(holds up the message)
(still looking at Emma)
(pauses, then crunches up the note and stuffs it in his pocket.)
(He sits.)
(She rises and exits.)
(finally)
(impressed)
(smiling)
(coming from the bedroom)
(they kiss)
(shocked)
(thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)
(he takes it off) for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it)
(She turns the cardboard box upside down over the conference table, a big piece of ham falls out.)
(to the others)
(he starts spreading envelopes among them)
(reading off his card)
(singing:)
(Mimics Chandler)
(Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe)
(entering in a Santa costume)
(Runs to Chandler and hugs him)
(Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
(to Chandler)
(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
(They kiss.)
(he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy)
(The phone rings; he answers it)
(simultaneously) Merry Christmas! (except for Phoebe...)
(simultaneous to the others)
(in a low voice)
(in the same low voice)
(interrupting him)
(simultaneously) Yeah, Merry... Christmas. (again, Phoebe...)
(simultaneous to the others)
(hanging up the phone)
(She gets hold of Chandler's tie, slowly moving her hands upwards on the tie, getting closer and closer to him, seductive.)
(He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)
(laughs)
(She lets go of his tie)
(She gets closer again, putting her arms around his torso.)
(flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.)
(Showing him the ring on her finger.)
(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.)
(thinks)
(breaking the kiss)
(They kiss again.)
(They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)
(They start making out again)
(interrupting)
(They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around:)
(Picks up a blue sweater.)
(Starts to leave.)
(looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
(Rubs her fake stomach.)
(They run out to get married.)
(They hug and kiss.)
(laughs)
(They kiss.)
(opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf)
(at the window)
(blinks an eye)
(realizing)
(flattered)
(to Chandler)
(to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)
(reading off his card)
(he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica:)
(she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler)
(start to sing)
(points to Molly)
(takes Emma from Rachel)
(to Chandler and Joey)
(goes to get coffee)
(Joey and Chandler clap their hands)
(opens the kitchen cabinet)
(relived)
(Mike throws out everything in his mouth)
(to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather)
(Gavin starts looking)
(can't remember)
(to Ross)
(goes to leave)
(to Joey)
(thinks about it)
(looks around, then focuses on Monica)
(to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)
(starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at cabinet under sink)
(they hear cracking voice from somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap)
(Runs over there to check)
(pause)
(takes the phone) Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)
(Rachel is upset)
(hangs up) (to Rachel)
(Rachel throws away that paper)
(leaves)
(to Monica)
(with Emma in a basinet)
(Molly leaves) (to Monica)
(put her glass down)
(Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you later (runs after Molly)
(opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)
(she and Mike leave)
(In a helium voice, holding a balloon)
(still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the door)
(upset)
(pause)
(admits)
(goes out of the room) Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha (they kiss on the lips in a romantic way). (to Ross)
(they leave the room, long pause)
(Chandler looks at him)
(opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers)
(Mike is shocked)
(Gavin shows up at the balcony windows)
(comes in to the balcony)
(looks at his watch)
(from inside)
(opens the card)
(opens the present, it's a green scarf)
(puts it around her neck)
(he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)
(sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)
(walks in)
(normal voice)
(shows a green jacket)
(likes the jacket)
(screams from another room)
(realizes)
(BEAT)
(A maniacal laugh follows.)
(Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like Santa Claus.)
(Laughs the real "plan-laugh.")
(BEAT)
(Runs out.)
(To Monica.)
(To Chandler.)
(BEAT) (Laughs.)
(sniffles)
(shocked) Really? (She looks around, suddenly embarrassed)
(Everybody cheers)
(hugging Chandler)
(inquisitive) Gosh, what's the pay like? (Everybody stares at her indignantly) Oh, come on people (defending) come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! (She looks at Joey) Hey Joey! (Joey winks at her)
(Joey nods)
(enthusiastic)
(grinning awkwardly)
(He turns to Joey, disappointed)
(entering)
(Monica smiles) ... and I smelled bacon. (taking some)
(puzzled) Who did? (Monica looks bewildered)
(entering)
(standing up, surprised)
(enthusiastic)
(still surprised)
(sighs)
(disbelieving)
(pointing at Monica, a look of recognition in their faces)
(almost laughing) I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. (They all laugh)
(sitting down)
(entering)
(shaking his head disbelievingly)
(he sits down)
(correcting him)
(They are shaking hands)
(He stands up and walks menacingly towards Joey)
(regaining confidence)
(He mimes flying out of the cannon)
(understandingly) Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a (He mimes wearing a feather on his head)
(He speaks in what he believes is a Southern accent)
(stunned, muttering)
(Joey hears that and his disappointment is reflected in his facial expression)
(Joey smiles smugly at this)
(interrupting their conversation) Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: (to Producer #1) 'How you doing?' (to Lennart again)
(explaining to Joey, who nods fervently)
(suggesting)
(taken aback)
(It looks like he has a gun under his coat)
(He searches his coat and freaks out)
(still in a high-pitched voice)
(He lifts his cap)
(simultaneously)
(excited)
(He stretches his hand out to him)
(They hug again)
(she nods)
(shocked)
(He sits down)
(Joey nods)
(entering, carrying a large box)
(standing up, walking towards him)
(He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)
(He takes the sneaker)
(They sit down again)
(determined)
(He takes a sneaker) And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! (to Monica)
(sitting down)
(bewildered)
(He points at Phoebe)
(shocked)
(disapproving)
(menacingly)
(laughing)
(worried)
(coughing)
(He looks at Monica)
(shocked)
(He stands up)
(entering)
(spotting Joey)
(interrupting)
(He seems to be in pain)
(walking on the spot)
(urgent)
(He turns to the producers)
(disbelieving)
(He grabs his jacket and limps out of the room)
(watching Joey leave)
(entering)
(He leaves the apartment)
(sitting on the couch) You know what these aren't half-bad! (to Rachel)
(He stands wearing the sneakers on)
(on the floor)
(spotting Ross)
(He looks positively surprised)
(interrupting)
(disbelieving)
(interrupting, pinching his year)
(shocked)
(apologetic) Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. (She smiles at him, but he doesn't understand)
(indignant)
(interrupting)

(Ross hides in the bedroom again)
(lets her in)
(he bounds into the lounge room)
(she leaves and slams the door behind her)
(on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause)
(abashed)
(even more abashed)
(Gives him the keys)
(hesitates for a moment)
(in a mocking voice)
(looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross)

(talking to a pineapple in his hand)
(pause)
(excited)
(he starts to ape her)"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)
(To Monica)

(to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)
(a few people raise their hands)
(a few raise their hands again)
(a few raise their hands)
(all raise their hands)

(raises her hand)
(they hug)
(smiling, raising her hand)
(Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers)

(excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)

(turns around to look at Rachel)
(Ross leaves)
(To himself)
(now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder)
(To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)
(the actor does so)
(To Rachel)

(after a short hesitation)
(realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause)

(pushes her head back down)
(Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)

(gesturing at an imaginary painting)
(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!)
(Looks confused)
(Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting)
(stops him form doing so)
(reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
(Slaps his hand)
(To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there)
(Slightly panicky)
(smiling again)
(stares at her intently, then yells)
(Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
(Phoebe looks devastated)
(now lifts her head)
(walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers)

(slowly)
(to Charlie)
(stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross)
(aside, to Ross)
(confidently)
(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in)
(pause) No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)
(very quickly and wringing hands) Of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said (excitedly)
(pause)
(seriously)
(weeping)
(still weeping)
(imitating the receptionist's tone)
(angrily)
(through the door, with a Scottish accent)
(while Joey's giving her a massage)
(speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan)
(to Joey)

(to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)
(entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone)

(entering)
(long pause)
(Dr. Connelly glares at him)
(to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)
(entering)
(he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason)

(entering)
(she goes)
(she goes)
(sitting down on the couch)
(stopping Joey)
(puzzled)
(looking astonished)
(reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin)

(Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an "ok" sign)
(M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)
(Proceeding with his dinner)
(Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her)
(at which she walks away)
(to Charlie)
(pretends to be stunned)
(smiling)
(after a pause)
(Looks ashamed)
(To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
(confused) You're welcome. (Ross hugs him again)
(impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)
(they hug)

(after a while)
(laughing)
(Excited)
(then to Charlie)
(looks at Ross matter-of-factly)
(to Charlie)
(smiling)
(a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them)
(Ross agrees)
(removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)
(smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats)
(looks very shocked)
(Joey, Chandler and David leave)
(to Chandler)
(shouts after David)
(shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe)
(looks at Joey who is at the check in desk)
(Removes a ring box from his pocket and opens it to show Chandler the ring)
(looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is)
(slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)
(Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)
(goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel)
(looking very serious)
(Monica and Phoebe go to one side)
(gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout "No! No!")
(Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler)
(Chandler tries to look offended)
(offended) What? (pause)
(looking out the window)
(at the laptop)
(Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him)
(Goes to the laptop)
(Ross looks at him)
(Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)
(Chandler runs out)
(Looks at Joey)
(Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused)
(Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave)
(sounds shocked and sits down)
(Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)
(Mike hangs up the phone)
(sarcastically)
(pretending not to sense the tone)
(pointing at her)
(stopping the waiter)
(walks away)
(walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge)
(picking up another random badge)
(he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)
(he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)
(they walk away)
(he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)
(he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment)
(he goes to get the champagne)

(pause)
(eagerly)
(to Joey)
(To Charlie)
(they leave)
(doing David)
(Chandler hits his own head)
(turns around)
(Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast)
(annoyed)
(he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)
(Phoebe looks very flattered)
(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering)
(he leaves)
(they hug)
(to everybody)
(she snuggles to him)
(walking in hurriedly)
(from across the wall)
(to a paleontologist sitting next to him)
(to the one sitting next to him)
(concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses)
(shaking hands with Ross)
(sighs) I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... (sighs again and smiles at Ross blissfully)
(with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)
(to Monica)
(to Ross, in a flattering tone)
(puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe)
(popping by, smiling)
(skating over, embarrassed)
(they leave)
(she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)
(giggles)
(smiling broadly)
(pauses)
(joking)
(realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling)
(her hair bigger then before)
(Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset)
(pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler)
(disappointed)
(hesitatingly)
(walking in)
(stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)
(disappointed)
(pauses)
(interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)
(bewildered)
(sitting down on the bed)
(sighs, with folded arms)
(smiling)
(points to his forehead)
(disbelieving) I think I will be all right! (to Monica)
(nearly whispering)
(to Phoebe)
(nearly shouting)
(interrupting her)
(going through her pockets) No... (to Chandler and Phoebe)
(picks up a coin from her bra)
(angry)
(smiling proudly)
(meteorologist) (pointing to the East Coast)
(turns the TV off)
(Joey walks in)
(downhearted)
(worried)
(laughing)
(pretending to be offended)
(laughing sarcastically)
(sighs) What the hell is my problem? OH! (He falls back on the bed)
(sitting up again)
(gives her a meaningful look)
(stands up)
(shuts the door)
(nearly whispering)
(shocked)
(pauses)
(outraged)
(Joey goes to sit on the bed) Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at Joey, who's totally distraught)
(stands up)
(desperate)
(insinuating)
(puzzled)
(see link)
(smiling)
(charmed, but then recoiling)
(in a trembling voice) I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! (sighs)
(painfully)
(regretful) I'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes)
(to Phoebe)
(looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler)
(pointing at Mike and shouting)
(boasting)
(threatening)
(Phoebe kisses him)
(to Mike)
(doing Monica and mumbling)
(to Mike)
(pause)
(Mr. Oberblau giggles)
(seeing her) Oh, you're back... (to Ross)
(they move and sit down on a sofa)
(holding her hand)
(she breathes deeply) there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone (pause)
(merrily)
(standing) Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO, GO, GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)
(exhausted)
(in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)
(she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause)
(pause)
(to Chandler)
(In a loving voice)
(Still in a loving voice)
(to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike) loser! (back to Chandler)
(pause)
(pause)
(apparently unruffled)
(pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)
(plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)
(through wall)
(whispering)
(in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!)
(muffled)
(Joey nods)
(Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.)
(Chandler eagerly rushes over)
(they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down)
(twitches a bit, looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...)
(hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)
(also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to Phoebe)
(caresses the wall with his finger)
(walks to Phoebe and Monica)
(walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)
(knocks on door) Rach, you there? (Joey and Rachel both get up from the bed)
(Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.)
(knocks)
(looks around because she can't find Joey anymore)
(still looking to see where Joey went, and opens the door)
(looks around again)
(looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)
(clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went)
(still searching)
(now looking up at the ceiling)
(still can't find him)
(long pause and he twitches a bit)
(Joey walks to the door)
(turns around very fast)
(he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)
(and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head away again...)
(shakes her body so the shells tingle)
(he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)
(lets go of his hand)
(mouths "Good luck" to Joey and gets up from her seat)
(gasps)
(and she walks back to Joey, who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.)
(laughs and hangs up the phone)
(stunned)
(she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)
(plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again)
(she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)
(and she shakes her head more violently)
(gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)
(unpacking his bag)
(gasps)
(looks up)
(enters the kitchen)
(she starts to cry again)
(she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)
(looking disappointed)
(trying to untangle her)
(he pushes his breasts together from the side)
(they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)
(they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)
(Chandler looks up from his book.)
(Picks up the "Miss Congeniality" DVD)
(to Rachel)	Dude, chill! (to Ross)
(to Joey)
(Squeaky.)
(Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice) I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. (Screams.)
(Storms off.)
(reads a form in her lap)
(Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He squeezes her hand.)
(To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)
(To Chandler.)
(To Monica.)
(Laughs.)
(looks at the triplets)	Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. (Strokes Leslie's hair, and she moves a little.)
(to Monica)
(on the verge of tears)
(Runs off.)
(pause)
(he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
(He starts lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)
(They look at each other, both embarassed)
(entering)
(to Chandler) Hey sweetie! (they kiss)
(looking at Monica's legs)
(laughing)
(To Monica)
(he takes the card) Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist. (he goes away)
(she apes Amanda using an awful British accent)
(pause) (to Phoebe)
(apes Amanda in a british accent)
(to Chandler)
(assistant walk out, not impressed by this statement) (Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. He stands up in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)
(the sprayer starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)
(pause)
(sarcastically)
(annoyed)
(he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room)
(hysterically)
(Rachel does not answer and seems puzzled)
(he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica)
(to Amanda)
(Phoebe mouths 'no')
(leaving)
(Joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it)
(He stands up)
(Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
(looks at her suspiciously)
(Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)
(laughing)
(Still yelling)
(looking thoughtful)
(points to the hall)
(To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment)
(sees what he is doing)
(sits down)
(makes a face)
(Phoebe and Amanda hug)
(To Monica)
(In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to sit.)
(beaming)
(To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so)
(She starts laughing very proudly)
(to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging her (points at Monica)
(To Phoebe)
(Into the phone) Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)
(Also gets up and starts taking her purse)
(To Rachel)
(Starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)
(When she's done she throws her bra at him)
(starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited)
(She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger)
(She climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)
(announces more to herself than anyone else)
(starts smiling)
(quietly)
(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
(sighs)
(she enters)
(he enters)
(taping Joey with the cam)
(starts to prepare himself to say his "How You Doin'" line)
(To Phoebe)
(Joey starts laughing)
(points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance)
(to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room! Ross: (pointing the camcorder at himself)
(unconfidently)
(to everybody)
(to Joey)
(he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) “Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression” eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) “Love you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book)
(crying)
(nearly weeping)
(she starts singing)
(she picks up a book). “Sex and the single mother. (pause)
(stops recording)
(she sees the cake)
(sees the cake)
(staring at the cake)
(to Jack)
(on the phone)
(pause)
(Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him)
(speaking to the person on the phone again)
(takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler)
(Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)
(Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right there. (Puts the phone down)
(Points at herself and Chandler)
(leaves)
(Goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler)
(stops and thinks)
(Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)
(Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)
(Opens the door for them)
(Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)
(on the other side of the line)
(smiles)
(smile fades)
(Looks confused)
(sees the book he was reading before for his "dramatic reading") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room)
(She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look)
(Visibly excited)
(Also very excited)
(They all run toward the table with toys)
(Takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them)
(they do so)
(to the dog)
(turns to Chandler)
(sarcastically)
(he opens the box)
(shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.)
(looks back at the cake)
(she looks at the cake)
(embraces Emma tightly)
(to Ross and Rachel)
(holds up his index finger again)
(and holds up her finger)
(angrily)
(pointing at cake)
(they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really... (There's a lot of yelling and screaming coming from the hallway, and they get up to look at what's the noise all about. In the hallway, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe are having another wind-up animal race, yelling and screaming fanatically.) Phoebe: (yelling at the top of her voice)
(they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.)
(yelling at the top of her voice)
(They kiss and cuddle a little)
(surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed)
(she whispers)
(Writing on the papers)
(yelling from outside) Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! (she knocks on the door again)
(he opens the door)
(to Ross)
(pause)
(looks confused)
(gives up)
(they hug)
(Emma starts crying in the other room)
(Rachel goes to Emma)
(to Joey)
(using a laptop)
(he takes the laptop)
(he uses the Thesaurus)
(pause)
(thinks about it)
(the crowd starts cheering so he starts yelling)
(crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody)
(on the screen there’s written ‘Julie, will you marry me?’ and goes on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)
(looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes what she did)
(he hands it over to Chandler)
(reading)
(sounding very proud of himself)
(also reading it)
(shows the sentence to Joey)
(Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that' look)
(points at his own heart)
(he sees the bags)
(she snaps her finger and points at Joey, snaps her fingers again and points to the bags)

(points to Ross and Chandler)
(To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)
(Takes the phone)
(Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross)
(To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe)
(To Ross)
(Thinks for a moment)
(He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room)
(Defends Amy)
(Shocked)
(a little confused)
(points at her own to emphasize the word)
(looks at hem pleadingly)
(very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up and leaves)
(Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)
(Leaves)
(Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
(on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused)
(Still looks confused)
(surprised)
(To Emma)
(sounds excited)
(not excited anymore)
(Very excited about it)
(Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily)
(takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)
(Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him)
(Removes Emma's hat)
(sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him)
(Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps)
(points at Amy)
(To Amy)
(Sarcastically)
(looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief)
(shouting)
(very angry)
(pointing at Amy, shouting)
(seems distracted)
(looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up)
(Mike looks bewildered)
(people are laughing, while Mike still seems bewildered)
(shouting)
(picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself)
(and leaves for Rachel's room)
(gasps)
(frantically pointing at her nose)
(yelling)
(Yelling from Rachel's room)
(doesn't believe what she's hearing)
(gasps)
(embarrassed)
(touched)
(the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table)
(puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)
(she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)
(and now Mike kneels properly)
(they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...)
(She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand, whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to Rachel)
(she enters)
(she shows her ring)
(in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him)
(he takes his mug to toast Phoebe) Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause)
(to Rachel)
(angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start reading)
(everyone is a bit upset)
(proud of herself)
(he enters)
(Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.)
(silence)
(he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired! (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold)
(in a deeper voice)
(after a long pause he starts miming again)
(to Charlie)
(Phoebe shows her a horrific painting with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and she gasps.)
(faking happiness)
(he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go)
(he sits down)
(he leaves)
(he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake, go to work! (Joey runs away)
(glances over Ross' shoulder)
(she and Benjamin are hugging for very long and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop)
(introduces them to each other)
(he thumbs up)
(they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross' chair)
(to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie)
(they laugh) Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh more, and Ross start laughing too)
(laughs nervously)
(sarcastic)
(she flips the coin)
(sarcastic)
(sounds disappointed)
(Hands the tape back to him)
(looks at him suspiciously)
(sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey continues to look at him suspiciously)
(sounds confident)
(looks surprised)
(Rachel comes out of her room and is observing the conversation)
(now yelling) (pretending to look shocked)
(yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards his room)
(following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)
(In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone)
(nods)
(Rolls his eyes)
(shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question")
(annoyed)
(looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even kinda close! (Ross looks around confused)
(even more shocked)
(annoyed)
(stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it correctly)
(loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling)
(very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? (goes back into his room)
(Chandler looks worried)
(comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)
(Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door)
(smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')
(faking happiness)
(surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)
(sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to do)
(Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging)
(genuinely excited about it)
(offended)
(jumps at the chance to make that happen)
(Impatient with Rachel)
(Now yelling)
(Sarcastic)
(Skeptical)
(Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)
(enters from his bedroom)
(in a spooky, slow voice)
(gives Gladys to Monica)
(she pushes the painting back to Rachel)
(pushes her back again)
(there's a pause)
(she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)
(indignant)
(she puts her hand on Ross's cheek)
(puts his hand on Ross's other cheek)
(and they start to kiss)
(he kisses her)
(to Ross)

(pause)
(smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
(she puts a box on the table and opens it)
(Phoebe looks bewildered)
(She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause)
(Chandler slaps her on her back)
(she covers her mouth)
(she touches Emma’s head)
(to Emma)
(He starts pushing Emma)
(Emma giggles)
(Emma laughs)
(To Ross)
(he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down)
(to Mike)
(to the charity guy)
(he takes their check from a drawer)
( She storms out)
(Laura looks shocked)
(finally Monica concludes)
(someone knocks on the door)
(form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it back in his face)
(turns to his right to see three kids staring at him) (To the kids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go away)
(point to the kid that kicked him)
(looks at him suspiciously)
(He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater)
(Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again, afraid)
(Screams to interrupt Joey)
(Joey bangs on the door again)
(nervous smile)
(Lightly)
(thinks for a few seconds)
(Pulls Laura into the spare room)
(They come out and Chandler throws Joey behind the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler)
(To Chandler)
(laughs nervously)
(laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom)
(quivering with anger)
(escorting Joey to the door)
(He leaves)
(Joey lowers his bat)
(to Chandler)
(embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica)
(and he leaves the apartment, leaving her shocked)
(acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes the door behind him)
(laughing nervously)
(and points to her, very confident)
(to the Charity guy)
(she gives the check and pulls it back again)
(sarcastically pointing to Phoebe)
(takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us. (thinking)
(gives the check to Phoebe)
(looks at the amount on the check, and gasps)
(hangs up)
(nervously)
(and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)
(Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch)
(reluctantly)
(more confident)
(realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of the spider)
(skeptical)
(whispering to Ross)
(sarcastic)
(in a deep voice, mocking Ross)
(Chandler's laughing)
(she tastes what she has cooked)
(pause)
(after a long pause)
(she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)
(pause)
(he and Ross leave)
(she looks around)
(panicking)
(takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been)
(Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that)
(looks at the time)
(He opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)
(handing him his coat)
(he raises his hands and on his right one there's a Rangers foam finger)
(Rachel screams)
(he points the foam finger at the girls)
(spells it)
(he takes the trophy from Rachel's hands)
(realizing)
(he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)
(to Joey)
(Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)
(peeping)
(peeping)
(gasps)
(looking through the peephole again)
(then to Ross)
(Others start to agree but she continues)
(sarcastic)
(When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
(Reading the note) We know you're out there. (Rachel gasps)
(whispering)
(they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused)
(smiling from ear to ear)
(She places her hand over his "fire" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out)
(Phoebe reaches for the door, and tries to open it but it's locked)
(starts to knock on the door)
(speaking lower to Monica)
(Rolling her eyes)
(relieved)
(looking through the peephole)
(to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)
(A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)
(Ross picks it up)
(holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)
(gasps)
(Monica looks at Chandler)
(they all look appalled)
(She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys)
(Goes to unlock the door)
(to Ross)
(his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking)
(Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel)
(still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall)
(They both look away)
(His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall)
(smiling)
(Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel)
(goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica)
(to Ross, mouthing)
(in agony)
(to Chandler)
(sarcastically)
(looking at Joey's butt)
(looking at himself)
(to Monica)
(very emotional)
(they hug)
(she kisses Chandler)
(to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)
(to Joey)
(the girl leaves and Phoebe goes toward the couch) (to Phoebe)
(he winks at Rachel)
(pointing at himself)
(he starts writing on his hand)
(entering)
(he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on)
(Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause)
(the man leaves)
(he enters with Erica)
(whispering)
(astonished)
(overlapping)
(he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video)
(to Rachel)
(to Joey)
(mad and pointing a finger to himself)
(he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts)
(he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh)
(she picks up a blue sweater)
(feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price)
(walking to Ross carrying a black leather jacket)
(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”)
(to Phoebe)
(she holds Chandler hands)
(to Monica)
(to Chandler)
(to Erica)
(to the agency guy)
(to Chandler, who looks bewildered)
(to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs)
(looking into one of her shopping bags)
(to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
(not getting it)
(now laughing a little)
(looking a little agitated now)
(getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey)
(looks very convinced about what she just said)
(very emotional)
(Almost crying)
(realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug)
(sniffing)
(sets the plate down)
(Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)
(looks over at Joey's platter)
(Holds the plate between Sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)
(takes a few from the plate, puts one in her mouth and places the rest on her plate, then starts to reach over to Joey's platter again)
(Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own)
(grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)
(Visibly annoyed)
(bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it)
(The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt)
(starts to take her coat off)
(gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)
(smiling)
(Jokingly)
(More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy. (pushes it aside)
(tasting hers) Oh my God! (Looks at the waiter and then to Joey)
(holding up his own dessert)
(laughing)
(laughing)
(puts her plate back at her side of the table)
(laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room)
(to the torte)
(pointing to a picture on the table)
(gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler)
(holds up the sonogram)
(makes quotation signs in the air)
(walks a few paces)
(walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again)
(nods)
(shouting to Ross)
(really excited)
(with no hesitation)
(looking at her)
(to Phoebe)
(looking outside the window) Look, there's Chandler. (he's on the street, talking to a woman)
(looking outside)
(she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler)
(picking up the phone)
(back to Central Perk)
(shocked)
(whispering)
(glancing at her)
(to Chandler at the phone)
(patting her bag)
(pause)
(Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)
(yelling in pain)
(she releases him)
(Phoebe starts pinching him again)
(puzzled)
(walking towards her to hold her and support her)
(to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)
(to Chandler)
(goes to Chandler)
(turns to them)
(motions them to sit and they do)
(clearly shocked)
(sarcastic)
(to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)
(to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan)
(smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)
(Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge)
(goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)
(Points to Rachel and Phoebe)
(talking on the phone)
(they don’t move)
(he has a turkey on his head)
(walks him to the kitchen)
(She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.)
(shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
(The guys celebrate.)
(to the girls)
(He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.)
(To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
(She opens the door.)
(running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow)
(panicking)
(To Chandler)
(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.)
(To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
(entering)
(He kisses her.)
(She turns around and hugs him.)
(She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
(Joey pats Ross on his back)
(nods towards Ross)
(to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica)
(to Monica)
(he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)
(they hug)
(quickly)
(she got a scarf)
(she got earrings)
(he got a sweater)
(he got a meatball sandwich)
(speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich)
(stopping Joey from answering)
(to Joey)
(very excited)
(singing)
(singing)
(to Monica)
(looking around)
(looks over at her)
(she leaves)
(angrily)
(they shake hands)
(he walks towards Missy)
(Joey's amazed at the place and he keeps looking around till he realizes the audience is applauding him)
(to Gene) I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! (pause)
(applause)
(on the screen there's the word "Supermarket") Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn't have said 'supermarket'. The next word appears, "notebook")
(whispering) more like a notebook... Damn it! (next word appears: "blueprint") Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey... (the last word is "Football field" and there are 5 seconds left)
(time's finished)
(to Rachel)
(she drinks her tea)
(pause)
(she air quotes band)
(angrily)
(to Rachel)
(pretends to be shocked)
(Excited, running back to her seat)
(looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)
(coughs)
(he shakes his hips) downtown! (Monica points Phoebe)
(he thrusts his pelvis towards Phoebe) Whaaaa... (walks back to plug in his cd player)
(pause) Did someone call for the long arm of the law? (He extends his arm from around his crotch and then upward and outward, towards Phoebe) I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! (Puts his hands over his crotch)
(he turn off the music)
(goes to get it)
(turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)
(points at his groin)
(making a crying face)
(walks towards Phoebe and the stripper)
(To Phoebe)
(To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)
(Joey goes form looking very confident to looking very shocked the instant the word congress is said)
(Next word: "Rotunda") Pass. (Next word: "Filibuster" stares at it a moment) Pass. (Henrietta is looking very confused) (Next word: "Addendum" 4 seconds remaining)
(Next word: "Joint session", but time's up, Joey acts very disappointed)
(Gene is clapping his hands looking very happy and so is Joey) And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani (Both of their smiles fade away instantly)
(To Chandler)
(to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them)
(Ross just stares at him)
(A girl behind them turns around)
(They move away from her)
(Rachel laughs excitedly)
(They spot Chandler)
(They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails)
(points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do)
(smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel)
(rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)
(Goes off to find Ross.)
(They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)
(they walk towards the bar)
(looks disappointed in himself)
(hands him a drink)
(smiling a little nervously)
(sighs)
(thinks about it for a few seconds)
(Chandler approaches)
(A guy enters holding a pizza box)
(she runs to the pizza guy)
(finishing the last of her drink)
(sarcastic)
(blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers "Oh my God!")
(Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away)
(She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
(after a pause)
(to Phoebe)
(out of breath)
(nervously)
(irritable) Sure. (Joey gets even more nervous)
(runs off)
(sympathetic)
(Joey seems lost)
(instantly)
(5 seconds left)
(irritated)
(looking around)
(screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)
(realizing)
(Chandler gets an "oh no!" look on his face)
(afraid)
(they hug)
(takes her hand) Listen, I hope... that you know... (has difficulty saying it)
(her mobile phone rings) Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! (she answers)
(she enters with a headset on and she's speaking into the microphone)
(she hangs up too)
(screaming)
(her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up)
(Phoebe looks shocked)
(looking angry)
(he kisses Phoebe)
(he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him)
(coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)
(to Rachel)
(Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)
(staring at the floor)
(Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross)
(looking at Phoebe eating something)
(Ross stands up)
(standing up too)
(he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid)
(he leaves)
(to Chandler)
(almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)
(he suddenly becomes very serious)
(Mike looks bewildered)
(Rachel is walking by)
(excited and clapping her hands in front of her face)
(Monica approaches)
(to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)
(to Phoebe and Mike)
(very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)
(she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat)
(Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause)
(mimes the CUT again) (pause and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)
(hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)
(he goes to Rachel's room, knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp)
(waving his fist in the air in triumph)
(thinks a moment)
(to Mike)
(looking around the room)
(Mike sits on his bed, and Joey towers over him. He starts talking in an Italian godfather-type voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head)
(not amused)
(gets up)
(very satisfied and smiling)
(almost crying)
(Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him)
(Getting up and raising his fist in victory)
(not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway)
(listens) Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. (switches calls)
(walks away)
(Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling)
(starting to panic)
(staring at the ice sculpture) How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (They all glare at him)
(smiling to himself)
(smiling to himself too)
(barely containing himself at this point)
(they both stare at Rachel)
(he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)
(sarcastic)
(enjoying what she's seeing)
(to Monica)
(Sounds moved)
(Nearly in tears)
(Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe)
(sounds scared already)
(Opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)
(to Rachel) Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe)
(Putting down her phone)
(To Phoebe and Mike)
(Turning to Mike)
(turning to Monica)
(thinking)
(walking around with her headset still on) OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. (He does so and the lights above the chairs light up. Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)
(kisses his dad) Hi! (kisses his mom)
(leans in towards Mike) I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... (to his wife)
(to Chandler and Ross)
(moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out)
(takes Chappy from Mike) Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy)
(quickly)
(to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away)
(they walk off, Ross looks down to Chappy, who he's holding and he gets a whiff of the dog's smell. He is clearly disgusted by it.)
(Chandler waves)
(she gives her a kiss)
(Phoebe leans in to kiss her.) Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell. (the girls hug)
(in her microphone) It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. (to all)
(to Monica)
(checking her clipboard)
(Monica walks outside)
(into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes)
(nervously)
(whispering to Phoebe)
(She puts the ring on Mikes finger)
(He puts the ring on Phoebe's finger.)
(everyone applauds)
(to Ross, sarcastically)
(whispering)
(she's not amused)
(he enters)
(he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)
(looking at Rachel entering with Emma)
(crying)
(hugging him)
(Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
(slowly)
(entering with Erica and Chandler)
(to Monica)
(stopping a nurse who's coming out of a room)
(They enter. Rachel sees his father, lying on a bed, with tubes, drip and everything)
(leaving)
(pause)
(he buzzes for the nurse) Let's see if we can get that Rachel back here	Ross (he buzzes for the nurse)
(she leaves)
(he goes out calling her) Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! (he gives up)
(pause)
(pause)
(Rachel sits on her bed)
(pause)
(she's sad)
(he kisses her on her forehead)
(She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her)
(They hug)
(There's one of those moments. They're staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed)
(he leaves)
(outside her room, talking by himself)
(enters the room wearing an "I love New York" t-shirt, a "Statue of Liberty" hat and carrying bags)
(Monica and Chandler look at each other)
(Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)
(Monica and Chandler look confused now)
(More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)
(They look hopeful)
(Monica and Chandler's jaws drop)
(He turns the light on)
(clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though)
(she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it)
(offended)
(She turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)
(starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)
(coldly)
(knowing she's not alright) O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)
(knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)
(she smiles fakely at him)
(half amused) Wait, wait, (looks around a little)
(sarcastically)
(acknowledging the last part of her sentence)
(sarcastic) Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
(She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)
(The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green, are you feeling better? (Rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look)
(To Chandler) We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob (Monica smiles at Chandler and his he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife)
(struggling)
(To Monica)
(steps closer to Monica and speaks softly)
(smiling)
(nods in appreciation)
(clears his throat)
(Joey looks disappointed, but understands.)
(in a French accent)
(Translation: Listen, I will tell you the truth. He's my little bother. He's a bit retarded.)
(Translation: So, would you please just humor him?)
(to Joey)
(to Phoebe)
(to the director) Merci. Au revoir. (Translation: Thanks, goodbye.)
(long pause, they realize)
(after a pause)
(she enters her room and closes the door.)
(he leaves the apartment)
(she strikes it through with a pencil)
(he takes a full container of milk from the fridge)
(checking her watch)
(raising his glass)
(she shrugs)
(entering)
(they all look at each other when Ross grabs a plate)
(while entering)
(she also grabs a plate)
(they hug)
(enters) Guess what? (they all look expectantly at him)
(looking at Joey)
(pats Chandler on his leg)
(walks to the couch with coffee for Phoebe)
(enters)
(to Joey)
(he leaves)
(to maitre d')
(confused)
(to mr Zellner)
(shows her to sit)
(whispering to mr Zellner)
(Mr Zellner who sits behind Rachel shrugs)
(starts singing la la la la)
(to the woman behind her) This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. (she turns around and the clerk behind the counter heard her.)
(the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever)
(motions for the next person in line)
(showing the bottle)
(except Rachel)	Congratulations! (Rachel looks devastated)
(Gunther leaves, hurt)
(Rachel mouths "aah")
(except Rachel)
(Rachel starts crying)
(crying)
(to the others)
(she leaves the room)
(starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs out and hits him)
(squinting his eyes)
(glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly)
(He turns his back to them and starts humming)
(He kisses Phoebe)
(She smiles from ear to ear)
(afraid)
(looks at her astonished)
(not amused)
(sarcastic)
(turns the card around, obviously had the wrong answer)
(understanding)
(sighs)
(They shake on it as if they just made a pact)
(thinking)
(frustrated)
(Joey glares at her angrily)
(having difficulty admitting it)
(In near tears, realizes she is right)
(his mood changes instantly) Just when I thought we could be friends. (he leaves the room)
(looks at his face trying to remember his name)
(Is embarrassed for a moment, but it quickly passes) Well, now I don't have to. (The man leaves instantly)
(annoyed)
(stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder, looking very annoyed. He finally manages) (sarcastic)
(turns around) Mark? Oh my God! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
(To Ross) What's with the chair. (Rachel signals him not to mention she's been fired)
(laughs stupidly)
(back to Rachel)
(looks at her box and chair)
(shakes Ross' hand)
(Mark looks at him strangely and walks off)
(very excited)
(realizing)
(looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into, and out of the camera's view, and then nonchalantly walks away)
(entering)
(frightened)
(they all hug)
(to Mike)
(shrugs)
(they shake hands)
(without moving her lips, wearing a fake smile) Okay, I will. (to Rita)
(he looks surprised)
(entering)
(speaking without pause, agitated)
(gasps)
(they all stare at each other)
(at the other end of the line) I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on. (she puts the phone at the bears ear)
(gasps)
(we see Ross stare in disbelief)
(Monica looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
(they hug)
(Ross looks very sad. Phoebe and Joey enter.)
(to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to Monica and Chandler)
(they hug, but Joey shakes his head.) Yay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in)
(walking towards Joey)
(He walks out, and Rachel follows him)
(Chandler and Monica look puzzled)
(shakes hands)
(surprised)
(he gets up and walks to the door. On his way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one up.)
(Ross looks very surprised)
(Mr. Zellner looks shocked)
(taking his cell phone out of a pocket)
(she leaves)
(doing Estelle)
(Joey nods in agreement)
(pause). This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you’re fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone)
(They high-five)
(to Monica)
(Joey considers it)
(she thinks)
(impressed)
(picking up her bag)
(Phoebe stops herself from laughing and leaves)
(does her irritating laugh). So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie (playfully punches Chandler, who tries to get away from her)
(at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)
(Janice gasps)
(To Monica and with bulging eyes)
(looks confused and scared)
(Chandler and Monica are utterly shocked) Ellen, we're going to talk numbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside)
(Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands)
(apes Janice's voice)
(She shows this with her index finger, mimicking it pushing something up)
(looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)
(enters) It's me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed)
(looks hopeful)
(obviously amused)
(Takes a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers)
(Takes a long look at the egg while he considers it) Wow, that's pretty cool (Takes the egg from Ross)
(grins)
(looks at Ross, for a long moment, confused)
(shakes his head, give him a thumbs up and leaves)
(Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up)
(on the other side of the line, still pretending to be Estelle) Joey, it's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)
(still scared)
(Starts looking around the room, terrified)
(Looks around)
(Hangs up and reads the phone display)
(Janice laugh)
(laughs)
(stunned)
(she kisses Chandler flat on the mouth. Chandler squirms. When she's finished, he looks at her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing. (She leaves)
(speaking as in pain)
(hesitant)
(she sits down, and Ross who is stunned to hear all this follows her example)
(they both stare around)
(after a long pause)
(picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner)
(They hug)
(They're still hugging - fade out)
(Joey looks at the photograph) ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (Joey looks for his notes. The man next to him is chewing something.) Dude, where's my speech? (the man swallows something and looks at Joey.) That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. (he applauds and Al shows that there's nothing left in his mouth.)
(she flips the coin)
(pause)
(she takes her bag)
(they hug)
(she opens her bag)
(they both start opening boxes)
(to Joey)
(pause)
(he stares at her breasts)
(to Ross)
(pause)
(standing up)
(he balance things)
(Ross starts punching him too)
(enters the room)
(Monica leaves, Ross closes the door). All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts)
(holding a pair of furry handcuffs)
(watching the food on the table)	Wow, this is quite a spread! (pause)
(entering the room)
(crying)
(Ross and Joey looks puzzled)
(to Ross)
(he stops and starts realizing something)
(to Rachel)
(they go into the guest room)
(she takes something out from her pocket)
(she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it)
(she holds the furry handcuffs)
(he looks excited)
(he doesn't look excited anymore)
(they hug) Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch! (they hug again)
(to Monica)
(Monica goes into the guest room)
(to Phoebe)
(pause)
(starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she's saying)
(having the same problem)
(says something that cannot be understood)
(again saying something that cannot be understood)
(they hug)
(to Joey)
(to Rachel) Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
(laughs)
(from the other side of the room)
(to Chandler)
(to Phoebe)
(she giggles, Chandler looks aghast)
(all mushy) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug)
(blows raspberry, and the hug ends)
(to Ross)
(looking out to the balcony)
(holding Ross's shoulder)
(pats Ross on his back, but he looks very surprised)
(still very emotional)
(annoyed) O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? (Joey gives Ross a hug) NOT FROM YOU! (Joey lets go)
(talking agitated and angry)
(makes choking noises) IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)
(he mimes hitting his head with his fist)
(to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
(they all look at the pictures)
(she looks likes she is in pain, holding her belly)
(she's hyperventilating)
(in pain)
(she starts to stuff styrofoam peanuts down the front of Joey's pants.)
(she stuffs some more down his pants and Joey's assesses the how many there already are in there.)
(in pain) Doesn't work... (he falls down on on his knees with his head on the floor)
(V.O.)
(screaming)
(quietly)
(Singing)
(interrupting)
(She hugs him, and Ross looks crushed.)
(emotional)
(to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on the verge of tears)
(To Erica)
(to the doctor)
(to Erica)
(To Monica)
(panicking)
(smiles)
(shocked)
(To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor)
(Singing)
(touched)
(To Monica)
(points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at the baby Chandler is holding)
(To Phoebe)
(Looks at Phoebe)
(screaming)
(screaming)
(with a French accent)
(yelling)
(he touches the players as he says the following)
(To Ross)
(screaming)
(on the answering machine)
(on the answering machine)
(on the answering machine)
(on the answering machine)
